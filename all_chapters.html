      PREFACE.
      
      
      <p>THE pleasure experienced by the author in perusing the scattered records
         of female excellence, gave rise to the idea that an interesting
         selection might be made from them, and prove not only instructive but
         useful. The acknowledged superiority of example over precept confirmed
         this opinion, and the ensuing narratives have been chosen as most
         suitable to the various conditions and trials of life.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Woman,— to whose fostering care the direction of infaney is
         intrusted,— to whom manhood is indebted for mental recreations and
         for consolation in difficulties,— upon whom also man, in declining
         years depends for solace and support,— too often betrays her
         incapacity to fulfil the important duties she is called upon to
         undertake. When thus circumstanced she frequently fails in the
         performance of a mother's tender obligations, and she not only loses the
         affections, but sinks in the estimation, of her husband; —, or
         immersed in the dissipations of society, she neglects to attend to those
         more sacred offices on which even her own happiness depends. To the just
         fulfillment of these, it is <img src=""></img> necessary she should think, feel, and
         act correctly; yet this cannot be expected while the ornamental
         accomplishments now cultivated with so much care, are allowed to
         supersede the more valuable acquirements. Painting, music, and dancing
         mauy afford agreeable recreation, but they must ever yield to the more
         important pursuits of life; the strict observance of the duties imposed
         on mother, daughter, sister, wife, and friend, commands the esteem and
         respect of others, and confers lasting happiness on ourselves. In the
         discharge of these how delightful to contemplate the examples of a
         <a name=""></a>Cornelia, a
         <a name=""></a>Lady Russel, and an
         <a name=""></a>Elizabeth Cazotte!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The performance of the domestic obligations, which are more calculated to
         court the esteem of the few than to excite the admiration of many, is
         the natural province of the sex: but Woman's sphere of action is not, at
         all times, to be so circumscribed: her intergrity, fortitude, courage,
         and presence of mind, may frequently be called forth by adventitious
         circumstances. In extraordinary times, as those in which we live, she
         may be placed in situations of difficultly, if not danger: let her then
         prepare herself to encounter them, by studying the examples now
         presented for her contemplation. Then, should her integrity be
         questioned, she may imitate that of the <a name=""></a>Duchess de
         Longueville; — should afflications
         overtake her, she may learn fortitute from <a name=""></a>Madame
         Roland; — should unexpected dangers
         await her, she may acquire courage and presence of mind from the conduct
         <img src=""></img> of <a name=""></a>Maragaret of Anjou; —
         and should the hour of trail occur, Britain will
         find her not deficient in patriotism: her trinkets and money will then,
         like those of the ladies of France
         and Rome, be laid on the altar of
         the her country. Her's will be the NOBLE DEEDS OF WOMAN! by uniting the
         sublime virtue of patriotism with the sublime virtue of patriotism with
         the exercise of every domestic and social duty!

      <q> "Ask the gray pilgrim by the surges cast On hostile shores, and
         numbed beneath the blast, Ask who revived him? who the hearth began To
         kindle? who with spilling goblet ran? Oh! he will dart one spark of
         youthful flame, And clasp his withered hands, and Woman name.”

      <p>H<small>OSPITALITY</small> has ever been a distinguishing
         characteristic of Woman; compassion not only graces the educated and
         polished European lady, but is equally inherent in the bosom of the wild
         unlettered savage, and their distressed fellow-creatures find a ready
         home and shelter with both: thus the shipwrecked mariner and the wayworn
         traveller surviving their perils, return to their native country to
         unite theirs to the many testimonies already received of the charity and
         hospitality of the female sex.

         </q>
      
      <p><a name="#WIrving"></a>W<small>ASHINGTON</small> I<small>RVING</small>, in his Life of Columbus,
         gives an interesting account of <a name="#Anacaona"></a>Anacaona, widow of <a name="#Caonabo"></a>Caonabo, who, after the capture of her husband by the
         Spaniards, had taken refuge with her brother, the Cacique Behechio, who
         governed the province of Xaragua.
      </p>
      
      <p>On the death of Behechio, Anacaona succeeded to the government. Her
         magnanimous spirit was evinced in her amicable treatment of the
         Spaniards, towards whom, notwithstanding the ruin in which they had
         involved her husband, who died their prisoner, she appears to have
         entertained no vindictive feeling.
      </p>
      
      <p>Notwithstanding the friendly behaviour of Anacaona, <a name="#GOvando"></a>Ovando, the Spanish general, imagined that
         there was a deep-laid conspiracy, among the Indians of Xaragua, to rise
         upon the Spaniards; and he "set out for that prodvince, at the head of
         three hundred foot soldiers, armed with swords, arquebuses, and
         crossbows, and seventy horsemen, with cuirasses, bucklers, and lances.
         He pretended that he was going on a mere visit to Anacaona, and to make
         an arrangement about the payment of tribute.
      </p>
      
      <p>"When Anacaona heard of this intended visit, she sent to all her
         tributary caciques, and to all her principal subjects, to assemble at
         her chief town, that they might receive the commander of the Spaniards
         with becoming ho- <img src="noble_008.jpg"></img>
          mage and distinction. As Ovando, at the head of
         his little army, approached, she went forth to meet him, according to
         the custom of her nation, attended by a great train of her most
         distinguished subjects, male and female. They received the Spaniards
         with the popular areytos, their national songs; the young women waving
         palm branches, and dancing before them.
      </p>
      
      <p>"Anacaona treated the governor with that natural graciousness and dignity
         for which she was celebrated. She gave him the largest house in the
         place for his residence, and his people were quartered in the houses
         adjoining. For several days the Spaniards were entertained with all the
         natural luxuries that the province afforded. National songs and dances,
         and games, were performed for their amusement, and there was every
         outward demonstration of the same hospitality, the same amity, that
         Anacaona had uniformly shown to white men.
      </p>
      
      <p>"Notwithstanding all this kindness, Ovando being persuaded that Anacaona
         secretly meditated a massacre of himself and his followers, resolved to
         anticipate the supposed plot by a counter-artifice, and to overwhelm
         this defenceless people in an indiscriminate and bloody vengeance.
      </p>
      
      <p>"He accordingly invited the Indians, in return, to witness certain
         national games of his country; and amongst other diversions was to be a
         tilting match, or joust with reeds, and all the Spaniards were secretly
         instructed to arm themselves with weapons of a more deadly 
         <img src="noble_009.jpg"></img>
          character, and to be in readiness for the
         signal of their commander.
      </p>
      
      <p>Anacaona, with her daughter, attendants, and all the caciques, were
         assembled in a house which commanded a view of the square in which the
         joust was to take place. "Ovando, perceiving that every thing was
         disposed according to his orders, gave the fatal signal. The house was
         surrounded and no one permitted to escape. The Spaniards entered, and
         seizing upon the caciques, bound them to the posts which supported the
         roof. Anacaona was led forth a prisoner. The unhappy caciques were then
         put to horrible tortures, until some of them, in the extremity of
         anguish, were made to accuse the queen and themselves of the plot with
         which they were charged. When this cruel mockery of judicial form had
         been executed, instead of preserving them for after-examination, fire
         was set to the house, and all the caciques perished miserably in the
         flames." 
      </p>
      
      <p>Mean while a most horrid massacre took place without; the armed horseman,
         sparing neither age nor sex, put the defenceless throng to an
         indiscriminate slaughter, and the princess Anacaona was carried in
         chains to San Domingo. "The mockery of a trial," continues the
         historian, "was given her, in which she was found guilty, on the
         confessions which had been wrung by tortures, from her subjects, and on
         the testimony of their butchers; and she was ignominiously hanged, and
         in the presence of <img src="noble_010.jpg"></img>
          the people whom she had so long and so signally
         befriended."
      </p>
      
      
      <q>"This ancient fortress of my race Shall be misfortune’s
         resting-place, Shelter and shield of the distress’d, No slaughter-house
         for shipwreck’d guest."</q>
      
      <p><a name="#DFerrara"></a>"R<small>ENATA</small>, Duchess of
         Ferrara,
         daughter of <a name="#KLouisXII"></a>Louis the Twelfth, and
         of <a name="#AnneoB"></a>Anne of Breagne, after her
         conversion to the Protestant faith, and her retirement to the castle of
         Montargis, was distinguished
         by her hospitality and goodness. She displayed her kindness more
         particularly towards her countrymen: every Frenchman, who in travelling
         through Ferrara was exposed to want
         or sickness, experienced her benevolence and liberality. After the
         return of the Duke of Guise from Italy, she saved, as the army passed through
         Ferrara, more than <i>ten thousand</i> of the French from perishing by
         want and hardships. Her steward representing to her the enormous sums
         which her bounty thus expended, 'What,' replied she, 'would you have me
         do? These are my countrymen, who would have been my subjects but for the
         Salic law.' During the civil wars in France, she retired into her city and castle of
         Montargis, where she
         received and supported numbers of distressed persons, who had been
         driven from their homes and estates."
      </p>
      
      <p>"I myself," says Brantome, "during the second period of these troubles,
         when the force <img src="noble_011.jpg"></img>
          of Gascoigne, consisting of eight thousand men, headed by
         Messrs. De Ferrides and De Mousales, were marching towards the king, and
         passing by Montargis, stopped as
         in duty bound to pay my respects to her. I myself saw, in her castle,
         above three hundred protestants, who had fled thither from all parts of
         the country. An old steward whom I had known at Ferrara and in France, protested to me that she fed daily more than
         three hundred people, who had taken refuge with her."
      </p>
      
      <p>----</p>
      <q>"If a hope of safety rest, 'Tis on the sacred name of guest."</q>
      
      <p>H<small>OSPITALITY</small> has been too often dangerous to
         those by whom it has been exercised: during the proscriptions of
         <a name="#Marius"></a>Marius and <a name="#Sylla"></a>Sylla, it was considered a crime against the state to
         afford shelter to the outlawed fugitives, and punished by the extreme
         penalty of the law. Yet, in those as well as later times, women have
         been found who, with a courage superior to all hazard, have dared to
         acquit themselves of this first duty to society, and who have chosen to
         peril their lives and fortunes, rather than violate its sacred ties. It
         is a painful reflection that such self-devoted and heroic beings should
         have sometimes experienced the basest ingratitude from the objects of
         their bounty; yet it was by no means an infrequent occurrence for those,
         whose disin- <img src="noble_012.jpg"></img>
          terested compassion had generously bestowed
         shelter and support to the houseless wanderer, to be, in return for such
         favours, denounced as traitors, for the sake of the paltry reward
         offered for their apprehension.
      </p>
      
      <p>An example of this occurred in the reign of <a name="#KJamesII"></a>James the Second. "During Monmouth's rebellion, one of
         his followers, knowing the humane disposition of a <a name="#MGaunt"></a>lady of the name of Gaunt, whose life was
         one continued exercise of beneficence, fled to her house, where he was
         concealed and maintained for some time. Hearing, however, of the
         proclamation which promised an indemnity and reward to those who
         discovered such as harboured the rebels, he betrayed his benefactress;
         and such was the spirit of justice and equity which prevailed among the
         ministers, that the ungrateful wretch was pardoned, and recompensed for
         his treachery, while his benefactress was <i>burnt
            alive</i> for her charity towards him."

      <p>"A<small>AFTER</small> the battle of Culloden, so fatal to the last hopes of the House of
         Stuart, <a name="#CStuart"></a>Colonel Stuart, attended by
         his friend, Mr. Hamilton of Balgour, sought his personal safety in
         flight. They approached a lonely hut in the Highlands, to which Mr.
         Hamilton went to ask
      </p>
      
      <img src="noble_013.jpg"></img>
      
      
      <p>shelter for an unfortunate stranger. The <a name="#HWidow"></a>good
         woman opened her wattled door, and his looks comprehended
         at once that a poor refugee was in distress: though she did not
         understand one word of English, she followed Mr. Hamilton to the spot
         where he had left Colonel Stuart, who addressed her in her native
         tongue, and as his case was desperate, confided to her their names and
         their peril. She told him the cattle were pasturing near her cottage;
         but if he would wait a little, she would send the herds out of view, and
         get him removed without exciting suspicion. Having succeeded in this,
         she kept them concealed for several days; and when they at length
         quitted their humane preserver, she loaded them with provisions,
         accompanied them for several miles, pointing out the unfrequented paths,
         or where they might venture to ask for a lodging, refusing at the same
         time the slightest remuneration. What adds to the merit of the action,
         is that the poor widow had lost two sons in the king’s cause, to which
         she was strongly attached."

      <p>T<small>HE</small> honourable and hospitable conduct of the
         Highlanders was well illustrated, at the <img src="noble_014.jpg"></img>
          same period, by the conduct of a clergyman and
         his wife, of the name of Gordon.
      </p>
      
      <p>"After the battle of Culloden,
         immense numbers of officers and men received refreshments from <a name="#MGordon"></a>Mrs. Gordon, and every part of the manse,
         except one room, was filled with the wounded. To guard against
         treachery, Mrs. Gordon lodged the fugitives in separate apartments. So
         cautiously did she conceal from each, the condition of the others, that
         the first request was, that they would not intrust her with their real
         names: she could serve them under a fictitious appellation. In this
         manner a father and son were five months under her roof, without knowing
         their proximity. Colonel Stuart, being a native of the neighbouring
         country, was personally known, and, with his usual impetuosity, had
         introduced his friend Mr. Hamilton, before Mrs. Gordon could ask him to
         give only a borrowed name. However, she said, the gentleman must in
         future assume the designation of Mr. Milton, and the colonel himself
         must be Mr. Grey. She gave separate chambers to each, and as Colonel
         Stuart was the most obnoxious to government, the window of his room
         allowed a speedy retreat to the lake, where a boat was constantly in
         waiting, to facilitate his escape to the upper district of Badenoch, in case of a close pursuit by
         the military stationed all around, to intercept the outlaws. In a few
         days Colonel Stuart found he must betake himself to his friends in the
         mountains; but the inquest in that quarter be- <img src="noble_015.jpg"></img>
          ing more rigid, he returned to Alvey, and
         hearing music and dancing, he got in at the window of his own room and
         went to bed. He had been two days and three nights without rest,
         sometimes hidden in caverns, sometimes even obliged to strip and plunge
         into a bog, covering his head with branches of birch, which he carried
         for the express purpose; and sometimes, like Charles the Second, he
         eluded his pursuers by ascending a tree. He was now disposed to sleep
         soundly, little suspecting that several officers were in the house. Mrs.
         Gordon had heard they were in search of Colonel Stuart. She hoped he was
         far off, but trembled for other guests; and the ready expedient of
         collecting some young people, and appearing heedlessly merry, she knew
         would divert suspicion. The officers, in place of ransacking the manse,
         joined the merry dancers, and went away after supper, convinced that a
         family so jovial could have no concealments. Some of the company were to
         sleep at the manse. Mrs. Gordon had then no spare room, except that
         occupied by her daughter; but she made as many beds as the floor could
         contain, and the young lady with her cousin were removed to Mr. Grey’s
         room. They undressed. One of them attempted to raise the bedclothes,
         when Colonel Stuart awoke. He had loaded pistols, and his sword
         unsheathed always beside him when he lay down to rest. Providentially
         the sword came first to hand. The candle had been extinguished, but a
         gleam of the moon showed a <img src="noble_016.jpg"></img>
          female figure, in time to advert the fatal
         thrust. Had Colonel Stuart seized the pistol, it must have been too late
         to recognize the daughter of his benefactress. The shock of a bare
         possibility of taking her life, he said, was more overwhelming than all
         his past misfortunes. She was Mrs. Gordon’s only child."
      </p>
      
      <p>Colonel Stuart pays the following tribute to the female sex: "In all our
         wanderings," says he, "we have preferred applying to the gentler sex.
         They never rejected us; and, if they could contribute to providing for
         our safety, after separating from them, we found they had a quick and
         clear perception of the means, and sympathy to stimulate their
         exertions, and to render them effectual. Even ladies, who were keen
         partisans of the House of Hanover, spared neither trouble nor expense in
         our behalf."

      <p>T<small>HE</small> celebrated traveler, Mr. <a name="#MPark"></a>Mungo Park, experienced the hospitality of
         the <a name="#AWoman"></a>female-sex on many occasions. “In
         his first African journey he had arrived at Sego, the capital of the kingdom of Bambarra, and sought to
         obtain a passage across the river to that part of the town in which the
         king resided; but owing <img src="noble_017.jpg"></img>
          to the crowd of passengers, he was detained two
         hours; during which time his majesty was apprized that a white man,
         poorly equipped was about to pass the river, to seek an audience. A
         chief was immediately sent, with an express order that the traveler
         should not cross without his majesty’s permission, and pointed to a
         village at some distance, where it was recommended that the stranger
         should pass the night. Park, not a little disconcerted, repaired to the
         village; but as the order had not been accompanied with any provision
         for his reception, he found every door shut. Turning his horse loose to
         graze, he was preparing, as a security from wild beasts, to climb a tree
         and sleep among the branches, when a beautiful and affecting incident
         occurred, which gives a most pleasing view of the negro character. An
         old woman returning from the labours of the field, cast on him a look of
         compassion, and desired him to follow her. She led him to an apartment
         in her hut, procured a fine fish, which she broiled for his supper, and
         spread a mat for him to sleep upon. She then desired her maidens, who
         had been gazing in fixed astonishment at the white man, to resume their
         tasks, which they continued to ply through a great part of the night.
         They cheered their labours with a song, which must have been composed
         <i>ex tempore</i>, since Mr. Park, with deep
         emotion, discovered that he himself was the subject of it. It said, in a
         strain of affecting simplicity,—‘The winds roared, and the rains
         fell. The <img src="noble_018.jpg"></img>
          poor white man, faint and weary, came and sat
         under our tree. He has no mother to bring hi milk, no wife to grind his
         corn.—<i>Chorus</i>—Let us pity the white man, no
         mother has he, &amp;c.’ Our traveler was much affected, and the next
         morning could not depart without requesting his landlady’s acceptance of
         the only gift he had left, two out of the four brass buttons that still
         remained on his waistcoat."

      <p>"W<small>HEN</small>, at the period of the French Revolution,
         the chiefs of Gironde party were fugitives in the south of France, and every where sought that
         asylum which was too often denied them by self-love and cowardice,
         Gaudet found a place of succour and safety in the house of one of his
         female relatives, whose name was <a name="#MBouquet"></a>Bouquet, not only for himself, but also for his friend
         Salles. The news of this unexpected relief being carried to three
         companies of the proscribed Deputies, they determined to beg this
         courageous woman to permit them to share in the retreat of their
         friends. A <img src="noble_019.jpg"></img>
          faithful messenger was found, and returned in a
         few hours with the answer. Madame Bouquet invited them to come; but, at
         the same time, recommended them not to approach her house till midnight,
         and to take every possible precaution not to be perceived by anyone;
         their safety in her house, which was what occupied her thoughts,
         depended greatly on these preliminary conditions.
      </p>
      
      <p>"They arrived at midnight. They found their friends lodged thirty feet
         under ground, in a large vault, the entrance to which was so concealed
         that it was impossible for a person ignorant of the circumstance to
         perceive it.
      </p>
      
      <p>"The continual residence of five men in this cellar, although it was very
         spacious, rendered the air so corrupt that, as it could not be renewed
         but with great difficulty, Madame Bouquet contrived, in another part of
         the house, a second asylum, more healthy, and almost as secure. A few
         days afterwards, Buzot and Petion informed them by letter, that having
         within fifteen days changed their place of retreat seven times, they
         were now reduced to the greatest distress. 'Let them both come,'
         exclaimed this generous woman.
      </p>
      
      <p>"All this time not a day passed without Madame Bouquet being menaced with
         a domiciliary visit, not a day in which the guillotine did not lay some
         heads in the dust. Too generous not to be liable to suspicion, this
         heroic woman each day heard the satellites of tyrrany swear, as they
         passed her habitation, that they would burn alive in their houses all
         <img src="noble_020.jpg"></img>
          who gave shelter to the proscribed
         Deputies.
      </p>
      
      <p>"'Well,' said she, 'let these inquisitors come. I am contented, provided
         you do not take upon yourselves to receive them; all that fear is, that
         they will arrest me, and then—what will become of you?'
      </p>
      
      <p>"Petion and Buzot arrived, and then there were seven of them. The
         difficulty to provide for them was great, provisions being extremely
         scarce in the department. Madame Bouquet’s house was allowed by the
         municipality only one pound of bread per day; but, fortunately, she had
         a stock of potatoes and dried kidney-beans. To save breakfast, it was
         agreed that her guests should not rise till noon. Vegetable soup was
         their whole dinner. After the day had closed, the Deputies silently and
         cautiously left their retreat, and assembled round their benefactress.
         She was in the midst of them as a mother among her children, for whom
         she devotes her life. Sometimes a morsel of beef, procured with great
         difficulty, an egg or two, some vegetables, and a little milk, formed
         the supper, of which the hostess ate but little, however entreated, the
         better to support her guests.
      </p>
      
      <p>"A month stole away in this peaceful security, with which was mingled the
         sweet enjoyment of generous affection and grateful friendship; when the
         Deputies, having some unusual reason to fear for the safety of their
         benefactress, forcibly expressed to her their appre- 
         <img src="noble_021.jpg"></img>
          hensions. 'Have I not lived sufficiently long?'
         replied this admirable woman, ‘having given you shelter? And is not
         death all that is to be desired, when one has done all the good
         possible?'
      </p>
      
      <p>"A circumstance which adds infinite value to this generosity was, that
         Madame Bouquet carefully concealed from her guests the uneasiness which
         secretly consumed her, occasioned by one of her relations, who had
         formerly been the intimate friend of Guadet. This man having learned
         what passed in Madame Bouquet’s house, set in action every means his
         mind could suggest, composed of falsehoods and artifices, the fruits of
         a pusillanimous temper and a miserable self-love, to induce her to
         banish the fugitives from her house. Every day he came to her with
         stories more terrible one than another. Sometimes he declared that he
         felt himself bound to denounce traitors put out of the sanction of the
         law; and then he would affect strong remonstrances in behalf of a family
         endangered by her imprudent conduct. He sometimes acted as if his mind
         was disordered by the terrors that, on her account, he indulged in; and,
         at length, fearing that he would take some sudden and desperate measure,
         endangering the lives of the Deputies, she felt it justice to them, to
         lay her situation before them. Her voice was almost stifled with grief
         as she spoke to them.
      </p>
      
      <p>"There was but one course for the Deputies to take; they resolved to quit
         their happy and peaceful asylum, and the moment of their separation, so
         mournful to all, and so fatal and <img src="noble_022.jpg"></img>
          eternal to most of them, was fixed for the
         following night.
      </p>
      
      <p>"Sad effects of civil dissension! Exemplary virtue passes for a crime;
         and instead of an altar reared to their glory, those whom it actuates
         are sent to the scaffold!
      </p>
      
      <p>"Suspected of having afforded an asylum to the fugitive deputies, it was
         not long before Madame Bouquet was arrested, together with the whole
         family of Guadet. It was well known with what tenderness and ingenuity
         the father of that Deputy sought to save his son, who, with his friend
         Salles, had taken refuge under his roof. Carried before the
         Revolutionary Tribunal of Bourdeaux, his judges were too prudent to question this
         venerable man concerning the concealment of his son; even they dreaded
         the touching voice of nature, and the indignation of virtue. He was
         simply asked why he had given asylum to Salles; to which the old man
         answered by clasping his hands, and raising them to Heaven. Witness of
         this afflicting scene, Madame Bouquet, as vehement in her indignation as
         she had been impassioned in her protection of the Deputies, had not
         power to listen in silence to such an interrogatory.
      </p>
      
      <p>"'Yes, monsters,' she cried, 'beasts of prey, fed with human blood! If
         humanity, if family affections are crimes, we all merit death.' Throwing
         herself into the arms of the elder Guadet, she burst into tears, adding,
         as she pressed the old man to her bosom, 'we have now only to die.'
      </p>
      <img src="noble_023.jpg"></img>
      
      
      <p>"The Tribunal, perceiving the increasing interest in the spectators of
         this affecting scene hastily closed the trial by pronouncing the fatal
         sentence of death.

         care. The fear of terrifying this <a name="#FFrenchwoman"></a>poor
         woman caused him, at first, to conceal from her his real
         situation; but having learnt from the public papers the execution of
         Guadet, at Bourdeaux, and that the
         government had extended their inveterate proscriptions to those friends
         of the outlawed Deputies who should give them shelter, and even to the
         domestics who would not reveal the places of their concealment, he
         determined immediately to declare himself, and prevail upon her to shun
         the impending danger by instantly quitting the house. The declaration of
         his misfortunes, so far from influencing this affectionate <img src="noble_024.jpg"></img>
          creature to avoid a participation of them, only
         made her resolute not to abandon him in the hour of danger. 'It is
         nothing to die,' said she, 'but it is a great deal to save the life of
         one’s master.'
      </p>

         should think of her own safety; it was enough, he assured her, that she
         kept the secret of his asylum; while to remain near him, served but to
         endanger her own life, without adding to the security of his. She
         rejected his reasons, and persisted to demand, as a special favour, the
         privilege of remaining with him. She prevailed, and through the zeal and
         exertions of this worthy domestic, Lanjuinais finally escaped the

      <p>"The scruples of St. Etienne were silenced by the perseverance of his
         friend; he was so received into her house, and partook of every
         consolation his miserable state would admit of. But the restless
         vigilance of the government soon discovered the retreat of the
         unfortunate St. Etienne, and the benevolent Madame Paysac speedily
         followed him to the guillotine with the same intrepidity she had shown
         in confronting danger to perfect his safety.

      <p>"I<small>N</small> the city of Brest, a stranger one day presented himself before a
         lady named Ruvilly, and besought her to grant him an asylum from <img src="noble_026.jpg"></img>
          the dangers of proscription. There was
         something in the appearance of this stranger that at once inspired
         respect and confidence; his gray hairs, the traces that sorrow had left
         on countenance, greatly affected <a name="#MRuvilly"></a>Madame
         Ruvilly, whose compassionate heart was ever alive to the
         claims of humanity. She did not consider her own danger, she did not
         even inquire who the person was to whom she was about to give a shelter
         that might involve her in utter ruin,—he was unfortunate, and
         Madame Ruvilly could not resist such a title. She concealed him, and
         sought to lessen the sense of his misfortunes by her kindness and
         attentions.
      </p>
      
      <p>"At the expiration of two days, the stranger came to take leave of her.
         Madame Ruvilly, whose pity and delicacy had forbade her to question him,
         could not forbear expressing her astonishment at his abrupt departure.
         'I am, Madam,' said he 'a priest; if I remain longer here my
         proscription will extend its fatal consequences to you. Suffer me to
         depart instantly, while you are yet safe, that I may not have the
         additional misery of bringing you to destruction.'
      </p>
      
      <p>"'But where will you go?' said Madame Ruvilly. 'God will direct me,'
         answered the stranger.—'What!' exclaimed Madame Ruvilly, 'know you
         not where to seek a retreat, and would you have me expose you to such
         danger? Ah no! I cannot consent to it. The more unprotected you are, the
         more it is my duty to shelter you. I beseech you to remain <img src="noble_027.jpg"></img>
          in this house, at least till a moment of less
         danger.'
      </p>
      
      <p>"The old man resisted so strongly the humane entreaties of Madame
         Ruvilly, that he came off victor in the generous contest; but though no
         one but a sister of Madame Ruvilly witnessed the scene, the traces of
         such generous hospitality were too soon detected. When summoned before
         the Revolutionary Tribunal, Madame Ruvilly avowed the only service she
         had rendered to the old priest; her only regret was the afflicting
         spectacle of her sister who was condemned to death, for not having
         denounced her to the Tribunal.

      <p>"These two women submitted to death with a pride of having incurred, from
         such a government, the penalties attached to the performance of a
         generous action."

      <p>DURING the second regency of <a name="#QBlanche"></a>Queen
         Blanche, wife of <a name="#KLouisVIII"></a>Louis
         VIII. of France, which commenced in 1248, the inhabitants
         of Chatenai and various towns, had, on arbitrary pretences, been
         imprisoned by the chapter of Paris. The deplorable condition of the
         French nation at this period was such, that the people were sold
         dependances with their lands.
      </p>
      
      <p>A crowd of victims, wanting even the necessaries of life, languished in
         the prisons of the
      </p>
      <img src="humanity_002.jpg"></img>
      
      
      
      <p>chapter. Blanche, touched with their situation, signified her desire that
         they might be released upon bail, assuring the chapter while she urged
         her request, that she herself would investigate the affair, and do them
         all manner of justice. The priests, incensed at an interference from the
         civil power, alleged, in reply, that the prisoners, whose lives they
         held at their disposal, were their subjects, over whom no other person
         had any authority. In defiance of Blanche, and in proof of the power
         which they thus asserted and abused, they seized also on the women and
         children whom they had before spared. The sufferings of the prisoners
         being thus aggravated, many of them perished with famine and
         pestilential disorders.
      </p>
      
      <p> The Regent, indignant at the despotism thus insolent and inhuman,
         determined to use with these merciless oppreisors the last argument of
         force. Proceeding with her guards to the prison gates, she commanded
         them to be opened. The soldiers hesitating to by her, she struck, with a
         stick site held in her hand, the first blow: the stroke being instantly
         seconded, the gates were quickly destroyed, when a crowd of miserable
         wretches, their faces squalid and disfigured, and their garments
         tattered, came forth. Casting themselves at the feet of the Queen, they
         implored her protection, without which the grace she had conferred upon
         them could serve but to aggravate their distress. Blanche, having
         promised to grant their request, took effectual measures for the
         fulfilment of her engagement.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Seizing upon the revenues of the chapter, she compelled their submission,
         and even obliged them to affranchise the inhabitants for a certain
         yearly stipend.

      <p>"During the period of the wars between the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily,
         <a name="#PCharles"></a>Charles, prince of Salerno,
         only son of the King of Naples, was taken prisoner by the Sicilians, and
         carried by them into Sicily : he was, however, fortunate enough to
         escape the general massacre of the Neapolitan prisoners, which took
         place immediately after their arrival in that kingdom.
      </p>
      
      <p><a name="#ConstantiaoA"></a>"Constantia of Arragon, who governed Sicily in the absence of her husband
         Peter, terrified by the ferocious clamours of the populace, who, on the
         destruction of the other prisoners, demanded the immediate execution of
         the Prince, sent him orders to prepare within a few hours for death.
         Fortunately for Charles, the day appointed for his death was a Friday :
         he received Constantia's
         message with an unmoved countenance, calmly replying, “I am well content
         to die that grievous death, remembering that my Lord and Saviour on this
         day voluntarily suffered his death and passion.”
      </p>
      
      <p>“Constantia was recalled to a sense of her</p>

         if he, for respect to that day, would suffer death so contentedly, she,
         for the love of him who on that day had pardoned his enemies, would
         pardon him also.’ From that moment she used every means to protect him
         from the ferocity of the Sicilians ; and by the employment sometimes of
         sometimes of conciliation, had him at last safely conducted to
         Arragon."

         affords a memorable instance humanity.
      </p>
      
      <p>When, after the siege of Calais, <a name="#SWalter"></a>Sir Walter de
         Manny returned to the camp of the victorious Edward,
         bringing with him the noble patriot <a name="#EStPierre"></a>Eustace
         de St. Pierre and his fellow hostages ; the monarch
         inquired, “ Are these the principal inhabitants of Calais ?" " They
         are,” answered Manny, " not only the principal 
      </p>
      <img src="humanity_004.jpg"></img>
      
      
      
      <p>Men of Calais, but the principal men in France, if virtue has any share
         in nobility.” 'Were they delivered peaceably;" inquired Edward : " was
         there no resistance, no commotion among the people?" "None in the least,
         Sire. The people would all have perished rather than have delivered the
         least of these to your Majesty : but they are self-delivered,
         self-devoted, and come to offer their inestimable heads as an ample
         equivalent for the ransom thousands."
      </p>
      
      <p>Edward was secretly piqued at this answer of Manny, but he knew the
         privilege of a British subject, and suppressed his resentment. “
         Experience," said he, " has ever shown that lenity only serves to invite
         people to new crimes. Severity at times is indispensably necessary to
         compel subjects to submission.— Go," he cried to an officer, " lead
         these men to execution." At this instant the sound of a trumpet was
         heard throughout the damp. The queen had just arrived with a
         reinforcement of gallant troops from England. Sir Walter de Manny flew
         to her Majesty and briefly informed her of the particulars respecting
         the six victims. As soon as Philippa had been welcomed by Edward and his
         court, her majesty desired a private audience. " My lord," said noble
         lady to her royal husband, " the question I am to enter upon, is not
         touching the lives of a few mechanics ; it respects the glory of my
         Edward, my husband, my king. You think you have sacrificed six of your
         enemies, to death. No, my lord, they have sentenced 
         <img src="humanity_005.jpg"></img>
          themselves. The stage on which they would suffer
         would be to them a stage of honour; but to Edward, a stage of shame; a
         reproach to his conquests, an indelible stain on his name." These words
         flashed conviction on the soul of Edward. " I have done wrong, very
         wrong," he exclaimed, " let the execution be instantly staid, and the
         captives brought before us." St. Pierre and his friends soon made their
         appearance ; when the queen thus addressed them : " Natives of France
         inhabitants of Calais! you have put us to a expense of blood and
         treasure in the recovery of our just and natural inheritance : but you
         have acted up to the best of an erroneous judgment, and we admire and
         honour in you that valour and virtue by which we are so long kept out of
         our rightful possessions. Noble burghers ! excellent citizens ! though
         you were tenfold the enemies of our person and our throne, we can feel
         nothing on our part as respect and affection for you. You have been
         sufficiently tried. We loose your chains : we snatch you from the
         scaffold ; and we thank you for that lesson of humiliation which you
         teach us, when you show us that excellence is not of blood, of title, or
         station ; that virtue gives a dignity superior to that of kings; that
         those whom the Almighty informs with sentiments like yours, are justly
         and universally raised above all human distinctions.” “Ah, my country !"
         exclaimed St. Pierre, is now that I tremble for you ; Edward only arms
         our cities, but Philippa conquers hearts.”

      <p><a name="#ECatherine"></a>CATHERINE the First, Empress of
         Russia, was celebrated for her humane and compassionate disposition.
         Upon many occasions during the lifetime of her husband, the <a name="#CPeter"></a>Czar Peter, she exerted all her influence
         with him in behalf of the unfortunate.
      </p>
      
      <p> This empress received the following handsome compliment from Motraye,
         who says, “She had in some sort the government of all his (Peter's)
         passions, and even saved the lives of a great many persons; she inspired
         with that humanity, which, in the opinion his subjects, nature seemed to
         have denied him. A word from her mouth in favour of a wretch just going
         to be sacrificed to his anger, would disarm him ; but if he was fully
         resolved gratify that passion, he would give orders for the execution
         when she was absent, for fear she should plead for the victim." In a
         word, to use the expression of the celebrated Munich, " Elle était
         proprement la mediatrice entre la monarque et ses sujets."
      </p>
      
      <p>After Peter's death the humanity of Catherine was still more remarkable.
         She had promised that during her reign nobody should put to death, and
         she kept her word. The test malefactors were only condemned to labour in
         the mines and at other public works; regulation not less prudent than
         humane, <img src="humanity_007.jpg"></img>
          since it rendered their punishment of so
         advantage to the state.

      <p>Catherine was the first sovereign that show this regard to the human

         unparalleled in the history of any other nation.

      <p><a name="#QCaroline"></a>Queen Caroline, wife of <a name="#KGeorgeII"></a>George the Second, being informed that
         her eldest daughter (after-wards <a name="#POrange"></a>Princess of
         Orange,) was accustomed, at going to rest, to employ one
         of the ladies of the court in reading aloud to her till she should drop
         asleep; and that on one occasion the Princess suffered the lady, who was
         indisposed, to continue the fatiguing duty until she fell down in a
         swoon, determined to inculcate on her daughter a lesson of humanity. The
         next night, the Queen, when in bed, sent for the Princess, and commanded
         her to read aloud. After some time her Royal Highness began to be tired
         of standing, and paused, in hopes of receiving an order to be seated.
         "Proceed,” said her Majesty. In a short <img src="humanity_008.jpg"></img>
          a second pause seemed to plead for the rest.
         “Read on," said the Queen again. The Princess again stopped and again
         received an order to proceed, till at length, faint and breathless, she
         was forced to complain. "Then," said this excellent parent, "if you than
         feel the pain of this exercise for one evening only, what must your
         attendants feel who do it every night? Hence learn, my daughter, never
         to indulge your own ease while you suffer your attendants to endure
         unnecessary fatigue.”

      <p>DURING the reign of the <a name="#MTheresa"></a>Empress Maria
         Theresa, a great scarcity of provisions prevailed in
         Bohemia, and numbers of famishing people flocked to the capital,
         (Prague,) imploring relief. The governor of the city wrote to court of
         Vienna, that the misery of the poor people was at length driving them to
         acts of turbulence and outrage, which he had not a sufficient force
         either to prevent or suppress. The Empress immediately despatched
         <a name="#GDalton"></a>General Count Dalton to take the
         command at Prague, to which several regiments were ordered to repair by
         forced marches. As soon as the Count found himself sufficiently
         reinforced, he ordered all the cannon on the ramparts to be turned
         against the city ; and hating so dispersed 
         <img src="humanity_009.jpg"></img>
          his troops that it was impossible for any of the
         disaffected to escape, he walked alone into the midst of some thousands
         of them who were assembled together, and addressing them with his hat in
         his hand, observed, it was not by criminal modes they should seek
         relief, because by so doing they must necessarily draw on their heads
         the vengeance of government ; he desired therefore, nay, he begged, that
         he might not be reduced to the fatal necessity of ordering his troops to
         disperse them. The people listened to the Count with great attention,
         and replied to him with a coolness which surprised him. They said, his
         artillery and his troops had no terrors for them; that what he
         threatened them with as rigour, they would consider as mercy ; for a
         speedy death with a cannon ball, was infinitely, preferable to the
         lingering death which they were suffering by famine. The Count was
         melted even to tears. He then addressed them again, and told them that
         his heart bled for them but it was his duty to preserve the peace o the
         city ; and he would be censured if, by his forbearance and compassion,
         that peace was destroyed ; he therefore entreated them as it were for
         his sake, to disperse, assuring them that he would immediately transmit
         a faithful, representation of their distresses to the Empress, from
         whose goodness they had reason to expect every kind of relief.
      </p>
      
      <p>The people whom the dread of death could not move, were filled with
         gratitude for the, general's conduct; they instantly began to <img src="humanity_010.jpg"></img>
          disperse, every man cheering him as he passed,
         and exclaiming, “ Long live Dalton !"
      </p>
      
      <p> The representation which the Count sent to Vienna, drew tears from the
         Empress. " Good God!” exclaimed she, " what have my poor people been
         suffering, without my knowledge! To what cruel miseries have they been
         exposed, through the ignorance I was in of their dwplorable situation!
         How greatly am I indebted to the moderation and humanity of Count
         Dalton, who has saved me from the guilt of being the butcher of my poor
         starving subjects, and who has painted in such moving colours those
         distresses, which others, whose duty it was to make them known to me,
         carefully concealed from my knowledge, representing the rising of the
         people as the effect of seditious disposition!"
      </p>
      
      <p> Her Majesty immediately despatched eight hundred wagons, loaded with
         corn, to Prague ; and sent a letter of thanks to General Dalton, in her
         own handwriting, for his meritorious behavior on this trying
         occasion.

         to the <a name="#FConvicts"></a>female convicts, and their
         assistance was requested. The behaviour of these women on the occasion
         was admirable. As many offered their services as were wanted, and
         continued faithful till dreadful scene was closed, none of them making
         any demand for their assistance till all we discharged. When requested
         to give up their bedsteads for the use of the sick at the hospital they
         most humanely offered even their bedding resigning willingly any little
         comforts they possessed to alleviate the wants of their distressed
         fellow-creatures.

      <p>During a conflict at the farm of Rainerhoff, in the Tyrolese war, in
         1809, a <a name="#SGirl"></a>young woman, who resided at
         the house, brought out a small cask of wine, with which to encourage and
         refresh the peasants ; she had advanced to the scene of action,
         regardless of the tremendous fire of the Bavarians carrying the wine
         upon her head, when a bullet struck the cask, and compelled her to let
         it go. Undaunted by this accident, she endeavoured to repair the
         mischief, by placing her thumb upon the orifice caused by the ball ; and
         then encouraged those nearest her to refresh themselves quickly, that
         she might not remain in her dangerous situation and suffer for her
         humane generosity to them.

      <p> DURING the siege of Saragossa in the year 1809, the <a name="#CBurita"></a>Countess Burita formed a corps of women
         for the relief of the wounded, and for the purpose of carrying

         unquestionable veracity in Saragossa, declared that they had frequently
         seen this young, delicate, and beautiful woman, coolly attending to the
         duties she had prescribed to herself, in <img src="humanity_013.jpg"></img>

         shells ; nor were they ever able to perceive from the first moment that
         she entered into these novel scenes, that the idea of personal danger
         could produce upon her the slightest effect, or bend her from her
         benevolent and patriotic purpose.

      <p>SOME years ago an instance of humanity and presence of mind occurred at a
         place called Noyon, in France, which deserves to commemorated here.

         drain, so affected by the foetid vapours, that they unable to ascend.
         The lateness of the (for it was eleven at night) rendered it difficult
         to procure assistance, and the delay must have been fatal, had not a
         <a name="#FServant"></a> young girl , a servant in the
         family, with courage and humanity that would have done honour to the
         most elevated station, at the hazard of her own life, attempted their
         deliverance. This generous girl, who was only seventeen years of age,
         was, at her own request, let down several times to poor men by a rope ;
         she was so fortunate as to save two of them pretty easily, but, in tying
         the third to the cord, which was let down to for that purpose, she found
         her breath failing, <img src="humanity_014.jpg"></img>
          and was so much affected by the vapour as to be
         in danger of suffocation. In this dreadful situation, she had the
         presence of mind to tie herself by her hair to the rope, and was drawn
         up almost expiring, with the poor man in whose behalf she had so
         humanely exerted herself.
      </p>
      
      <p>“ Far from being intimidated by the danger of the enterprise, the moment
         she recovered her spirits, she insisted upon being let down for the poor
         creature that remained, which she actually was ; but her exertions this
         time failed of success, for the unfortunate man was drawn dead.
      </p>
      
      <p>“ The corporation of the town of Nyon, as a small token of their
         approbation, presented the generous girl with six hundred livres' and
         conferred on her the civic crown, with a medal engraved with the arms of
         the town, her name, a narrative of the action. The Duke of Orleans also
         sent her five hundred livres, and settled two hundred yearly on her for
         life."

         has been theme of our admiration : together with our brothers and
         our husbands, we early learned to love the country of Homer,
         Aristides, of Solon, and of Socrates. That enthusiasm which the
         glory of ancient Greece enkindled in our bosoms, has preserved a
         fervent friendship for her descendants. We have beheld with deep
         sympathy the horrors of Turkish domination, and the struggle so long
         and nobly sustained by them for existence and for liberty.

         mourning over your dearest ones slain in battle.

         destitute of feeling, must beat with the warmest emotions of
         gratitude towards them, and be alive to the tenderness of filial
         piety. Thus we find that in all ages of the world, those who have

         they have been the natives of enlightened Europe, or of a land of unpolished savages, have
         always been distinguished, either in their <img src="noble_029.jpg"></img>
          infancy or at a more advanced period
         of life, by some trait of this affection, which appears to form a

      <p>T<small>HE</small> Roman history furnishes us with two
         remarkable examples of filial piety. A <a name="#RDaughter"></a>Roman lady, of illustrious birth, had for some cause
         been condemned to be strangled, and was sent to prison in order to
         be put to death. The gaoler, who
         had received orders to strangle her, was touched with compassion for
         her beauty and misfortunes, and not being able to resolve to kill
         her, determined to let her die of hunger. He however consented to
         allow her daughter to visit
         her in the prison, taking care that she brought her mother no food.
         Many days elapsed, during which the daughter's visits were very
         frequent: at length the gaoler became surprised that his prisoner
         could exist so long without sustenance. His suspicions immediately
         rested on the daughter, whom he now determined to watch still more
         closely: to his utmost astonishment he found that she nourished her
         mother with her own milk. His amazement at this pious and ingenious
         invention caused him to inform the triumvir of the circumstance, who
         immediately acquainted the praetor with it. The latter, <img src="noble_030.jpg"></img>
          considering it worthy the public
         attention, related it in an assembly of the people. The result was
         the pardon of the criminal; and, at the same time, a decree was
         passed, that for the future both mother and daughter should be
         supported at the public expense. The Romans also raised a Temple
         upon the spot, and dedicated it to Filial Piety.

      <p><a name="#Xantippe"></a>X<small>ANTIPPE</small>, another Roman lady, supported her aged father Cimonus in a similar manner, in
         order to preserve his life while in prison. This last circumstance
         was called the "Roman Charity." Both these pious actions appeared so
         extraordinary to that people, that they could only account for them
         by supposing that filial affection was the first law of nature.

      <p>M<small>ODERN</small> history commemorates the name of
         <a name="#MRoper"></a>Margaret Roper, the daughter of <a name="#SMore"></a>Sir Thomas
         More, as another illustrious example of this
         affection. When Sir Thomas, who had refused to take the oath of
         supremacy, was cast into <img src="noble_031.jpg"></img>
          prison, his daughter, who was
         overwhelmed with grief, was, through incessant importunity,
         permitted to visit him. Admitted at length to his prison, she
         endeavoured, by every argument, expostulation, and entreaty, to
         induce him to relent from his purpose. But her eloquence, her
         tenderness, and her tears, were alike ineffectual: constant to the
         last, the principles of this great and unfortunate man were not to
         be shaken. Margaret corresponded with her father during the whole of
         his imprisonment, and when deprived of pen and ink, Sir Thomas
         contrived to write to her by means of a coal.
      </p>
      
      <p>When sentence had been passed upon him, and he was returning towards
         the Tower, Margaret rushed through the populace and the guards, and,
         without speaking, threw her arms round her father's neck, clinging
         closely to him in the stupor of despair. Even the guards melted into
         compassion at this affecting scene. The fortitude of the noble
         prisoner seemed for a moment to be shaken with the sight of his
         daughter's sorrow. Tenderly embracing her, he withdrew himself from
         her arms. Scarcely however had he proceeded a few paces further,
         when she again rushed towards him, and, in a paroxysm of sorrow more
         eloquent than words, threw herself on his bosom. Tears flowed while
         he down the venerable cheeks of Sir Thomas while he gazed upon her
         with tender earnestness: having entreated her prayers for him, he
         bade her affectionately farewell.
      </p>
      
      <p>Margaret extended her cares to the lifeless <img src="noble_032.jpg"></img>
          remains of this beloved parent.
         Through her interest and exertions, his body was, after his
         execution, interred in the Chapel of St. Peter's <i>ad vincula</i>, within the precincts of the Tower: it was
         afterwards removed, according to the appointment which had been made
         by Sir Thomas during his lifetime, to the chancel of the church of
         Chelsea. His head, in conformity with the sentence, having remained
         fourteen days exposed upon London Bridge, would have been cast into
         the Thames, had it not been purchased by his daughter. Inhumanly
         summoned in consequence before the council, Margaret firmly
         acknowledged and justified her conduct. Such intrepidity could not
         escape<a name="#KHenryVIII"></a> King Henry's
         vengeance: she was cast into prison, whence, after some vain
         attempts to subdue her courage by menaces, she was permitted to
         escape, and join her husband and family. At her death, which took
         place nine years after these events, the head of her unfortunate
         parent was interred with her in her arms, according to some
         historians; or, as others say, deposited in a leaden box, and placed
         upon her coffin.

      <p>T<small>HE</small> exile of the <a name="#BRochester"></a>Bishop of
         Rochester gave occasion to a very interesting
         exercise of paternal tenderness on the one part, and of filial duty
         and affection on the other. What mostly <img src="noble_033.jpg"></img>
          embittered the banishment of the
         Bishop, was regret at leaving behind him his daughter, <a name="#MMorice"></a>Mrs.
         Morice, in an infirm state of health. A mutual
         longing to see one another took fast hold of the father and
         daughter; and the lady, though very ill, performed, with great
         difficulty and pain, a journey and voyage from Westminster to Bourdeaux, and Toulouse, where Dr. Atterbury resided. Mr. J.
         Evans accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Morice on their voyage from
         Dover to Bourdeaux, and from thence to
         Toulouse; and being present
         at Mrs. Morice’s death, in a letter to his brother, dated
         Montpelier, 30th November, 1729, gives the following very pathetic
         narrative of that event.
      </p>
      "On Sunday, the 6th instant, N.S. in the evening, we reached
      Blagnac, a village not
      above half a league by land from Toulouse; but by water (by reason of a very strong
      current, and the windings of the river,) it takes three hours to get
      up to the town. So it was resolved, rather than expose Mrs. Morice
      too much to the fatigue, (of which she had undergone an infinite
      deal, and bore it with incredible patience,) or keep her late on the
      water, to rest at Blagnac
      that night, where she was put to bed in the same weak condition she
      usually had been, but not seemingly worse. About midnight, the women
      came to Mr. Morice and me, and told us, they thought they saw her
      changed. We rose and came to her chamber, when we found her so very
      ill, that we thought fit to call up the boatmen, and order them to
      prepare the boat to depart immediately, fearing <img src="noble_034.jpg"></img>
       much, from the change we saw, that
      near she was to it, she would scarcely live to reach Toulouse, which we all earnestly
      desired to do, since no physician, or other help, could be had in
      the poor place where we then were. She herself pressed this matter;
      and we well knew that all her desires and wishes were constantly
      bent upon seeing her father, whom she hoped to find at Toulouse. She was taken out of bed at
      her own desire, and carried to the boat with great difficulty, not
      being able to sit in the chair which Mr. Morice had brought from
      Bourdeaux, with two
      chairmen, purely for the carrying her in and out of the boat more at
      ease; and so we parted thence about two o'clock in the morning,
      sending two servants, by land, to procure a litter to meet her at
      the by landing-place. About five we arrived there; and soon after
      six the litter came, which carried Mrs. Morice to the house in
      Toulouse, where her father
      was expecting her arrival, and not knowing, till then, how near or
      how far off she was, though he had despatched a man and horse to get
      intelligence of us, who happened to miss us. When the servants, who
      had been sent for the litter, returned, she was informed of the
      Bishop's being at Toulouse, and
      seemed to take new spirits upon it, which, no doubt, were of great
      use to enable her to bear going in the litter, which, otherwise, she
      could scarce have done even for so short a way. After she had been
      put into bed (where, as I told you, she never slept till she slept
      her last,) and had a little recovered the fatigue she underwent in
      
      <img src="noble_35.jpg"></img>
       the conveyance from the boat, which
      was about a mile, her father, whom she immediately inquired after,
      came into her room, and was startled to see her in so very low a
      condition. After mutual expressions of concern and tenderness, she
      particularly acknowledged the great blessing that was granted her,
      of meeting her dear papa; and exerted all the little life that was
      in her, in grasping his hands with her utmost force, as she often
      did; and told him, 'that meeting was the chief thing she bad
      ardently desired.'
      "The bishop some time after left her chamber, that she might compose
      herself, and that he might give vent to the just grief he was filled
      with, to see his beloved child in a manner expiring. But we found
      she took no rest: so he soon returned, and then said prayers by her,
      and proposed to her receiving the holy sacrament the next morning,
      when he hoped she might have been a little refreshed, in order to
      it: she embraced the offer with much satisfaction. He then asked
      her, for fear of any accident, if she was not desirous to have the
      absolution of the church? She declared she was, and begged to have
      it. After some little private discourse with her, he gave it to her,
      in the form prescribed in 'The Visitation of the Sick,' and she
      expressed great comfort of the fort upon receiving it. A physician
      had been sent for immediately upon her arrival. When he came, he
      gave little hopes, but said all depended upon her manner of passing
      that night.
      "She once mentioned Dr. Wyntle, who you <img src="noble_036.jpg"></img>
       know had been her physician; and who
      had so neglected her before she left England, as never to come near her, according to
      his appointment, nor give the least direction for her management in
      the long voyage she was about to make. She said to the Bishop 'Dear
      papa, has Mr. Morice told you how Dr. Wyntle has served us?' who
      answered, 'Yes, my dear, I know it all; but do not let that trouble
      you now.' She replied, 'O no, papa, I do not trouble myself about
      that I have other things to think of at this time; but I did not
      know whether Mr. Morice had told you.'
      "Hoping by this time she might incline to take a little rest, her
      father and husband retired, it being between eleven and twelve at
      night; but about two in the morning she sent one of her women to me,
      (who lay on the same floor, in the next room to her,) to desire to
      speak to me; and when I came, she said, not seemingly with much
      pain, but with such a shortness of breath that she was forced to
      breathe after every two or three words, 'Mr. Evans, I have been
      waking—these three hours—and would fain—have the sacrament.' I
      wondered at her sending for me on that account, her husband and
      father being both near at hand; but I found afterwards it was her
      unwillingness, by a direct message from herself, too much to alarm
      either of them. However, being then not apprized of her reason for
      it, I doubted a little of her being in her right senses, and said,
      'Madam, would you <i>now</i> receive the
      sacrament?' She said, 'Yes, I would, if possible—presently.' Of <img src="noble_037.jpg"></img>
       which the Bishop being immediately
      advised, as was Mr. Morice, and every thing being prepared, he came,
      and administered to her, and to all present, the sacrament; and
      afterwards, at her desire, continued repeating the prayers of the
      church, till she began to draw very near her end, and then he used
      and continued the recommendatory prayer only; she, all the while,
      holding her hands in a posture of prayer, and sometimes joining in a
      low voice with him.
      
      "After this, her father being gone from the bed-side, she called for
      him, (as she had frequently done,) and again said to him, 'Dear
      papa—what a blessing is it—that afer such a
      long—troublesome—journey—we have the comfort—of this meeting!' And,
      indeed, when I reflect upon it, and consider the weak condition she
      was in upon the road, the many accidents that happened to retard the
      voyage, and the last effort she made, when she was at the worst,
      think that that meeting seemed granted by heaven to her continued
      fervent prayers for it.
      "About this time she called for her husband, (who was always in near
      attendance upon her,) and said, 'Dear Mr. Morice—take care of the
      children—I know you will.—Remember me—to the Duchess of
      Buckingham.'
      "She also, in a proper place, recommended her servants to Mr.
      Morice.
      
      <p>"She now found her feet cold, and ordered them to be rubbed, at the
         same time calling for her broth; but when it came, not being able to
         <img src="noble_038.jpg"></img>
          swallow it, she turned herself on her
         left side, and rested her head on her left hand, which she doubled,
         extending her right hand and arm over the bed-clothes; and in this
         posture continued drawing her breath shorter and shorter, but with
         the least emotion that possibly could be, till she at last expired,
         a quarter before four o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 8th November,
         NS.

      <p>F<small>ROM</small> the preceding illustrious sample of
         the power of filial affection, we turn to one not less affecting,
         though displayed in a humbler path of life. In the severe winter of
         1783, Which was a time of general distress at New York, an  aged couple found themselves reduced to their
         last stick of wood. They had been supported by the industry of a
         <a name="#ADaughter"></a>daughter who lived with them, but
         who now found herself unable to procure them either fuel or
         provisions. Overcome with grief at their destitute situation, she
         yet devised an expedient by which they might be rescued from the
         emergency. She had accidentally heard that a dentist had advertised
         or to give three guineas for every only sound fore-tooth, provided
         only that he was allowed to extract it himself: the generous girl,
         on remembering this, came to the resolution of disposing of all her
         foreteeth, and went to the dentist for that purpose. On her arrival,
         she made known the circumstances which had induced her to make so
         uncommon a sacrifice.
      </p>
      
      <p>Affected even to tears by the girl’s filial affection, the dentist
         refused to avail himself of the offer, at the same time presenting
         her with ten guineas, with which, her heart overflowing with joy and
         gratitude, she hastened home to relieve her parents.

      <p>D<small>URING</small> the French Revolution, which
         endangered the lives of so many parents, filial affection, rising
         superior to all selfish considerations of safety, might be seen in
         many interesting forms. Daughters then subjected themselves to every
         indignity, in their endeavours to alleviate the sufferings of those
         who were dearer to them than life itself: kneeling at the feet of
         their inhuman persecutors, they besought some mitigation at least of
         their parents' sentence, and, if unsuccessful in these efforts,
         shared their prison, and voluntarily partook their unhappy fate.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><a name="#ECazotte"></a>Mademoiselle Cazotte, was an only child, and, at the
         commencement of the Revolution, her father was seventy-two years of age. Closely
         connected with La Porte (the intendant of the civil list), the fate
         of Cazotte was involved in his. Some of Cazotte's letters being
         found on the person of La Porte, the old man and his daughter were
         immediately arrested and sent to the prison of the Abbey.
      </p>
      
      <p>Shortly afterwards, Mademoiselle Cazotte having been pronounced
         innocent, an order arrived at the prison that she might be set at
         liberty. Elizabeth however refused to avail herself of it being
         resolved to share her father's fate, and she succeeded in obtaining
         permission to remain with him. While in and the prison, by her
         interesting appearance, and the pathetic eloquence of her language,
         she was so fortunate <img src="noble_041.jpg"></img>
          as to interest some Marseillois, who
         had quartered themselves in the Abbey, in her behalf; thus for a
         time her father’s life was safe. On the 2d of September, however,
         after an uninterrupted massacre, which had lasted three, hours, a
         number of voices called loudly for Cazotte. At that name, which
         seemed to threaten instant danger, Elizabeth rushed forward to meet
         her father's murderers. Her extreme youth, wonderful beauty, and
         uncommon courage, seemed to shake their purpose. One more stern and
         hardened in crime than the rest advanced to Cazotte, and demanded
         why he had been imprisoned with his daughter. "You will find it in
         the gaoler's book," was the old man's reply. Two of the party being
         sent to examine the book, shortly returned with the tidings that
         Cazotte was detained as a decided Counter-revolutionist. Scarcely
         was the report uttered, when an axe was raised over the head of
         Cazotte. His daughter, wildly shrieking, threw herself upon him,
         covering him with her body, and disdaining to descend to unworthy
         supplications, only demanded to die with him. " Strike, barbarians,"
         she cried; "you cannot reach my father but through my heart!" At
         this moving spectacle the assassins hesitated and trembled, while a
         shout of pardon! Pardon! Was heard from one individual, and echoed
         by a hundred voices. The Marseillois opened themselves a passage to
         the two victims, and the father and daughter, covered with this
         sacred shield, <img src="noble_042.jpg"></img>
          were conducted, with shouts of
         applause, from that habitation of misfortunes and crimes.
      </p>
      
      <p>The liberation of Cazotte, however, afforded temporary security: he
         was again arrested upon the institution of the Criminal Tribunal.
         The good old man endeavoured to dissuade his daughter from
         accompanying him to prison, but his prayers, entreaties, and tears
         nay even his positive commands, were here entirely fruitless. "In
         your company, my father" said Elizabeth, "I have faced the most
         cruel of assassins; and shall I not be the companion of your new
         misfortune, in which there is less danger? The hope of saving you
         will again support me; I will show to your judges your forehead
         furrowed with age I will ask them if a man, an old man, who has but
         a few days to linger out among his fellow-beings, may not find mercy
         in the eyes of justice, after having escaped the extreme of danger?
         If he, whose white hairs could plead with assassins, ought not to
         receive indulgence from magistrates, one of whose attributes should
         be mercy? The voice of nature will again be heard, and perhaps I may
         again save you from the cruel fate which impends over us." Overcome
         by her pressing entreaties Cazotte at last allowed his child to
         attend him to the prison. When however they arrived there, the
         unhappy girl was denied admission, and compelled to yield up her
         father. In an agony of grief, she hastened to the Commune, and to
         the Minister of the Interior, from whom, by her supplications and
         tears, she wrested their permission to attend her <img src="noble_043.jpg"></img>
          father. From that moment she devoted
         he wholly to him, spending day and night in administering to his
         comforts. The only time that she passed away from his prison, was
         employed in securing promises of support from the same <i>Marseillois</i>, who had formerly rendered her
         father such service; and she likewise, received promises from
         several ladies of distinction, that their interest should be exerted
         in her behalf. These expectations were, alas! vainly excited, for
         every human being abandoned them in the hour of trial.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When Cazotte was called before the Tribunal the old man appeared,
         supported by his daughter. A murmur of applause ran through the
         multitude that filled the court at this affecting sight, while
         Elizabeth, with her eyes fixed on her father, endeavoured to
         encourage and console him at this trying moment. The pleading was
         soon commenced: during the reading of the written evidence, and the
         speech of the Public Accuser, the entire feelings of Elizabeth were
         imprinted on her beautiful countenance. Every one remarked the
         variety of changes it underwent; fear and hope rapidly succeeding to
         each other: several times she was on the point of raising her voice,
         but was checked by remembering that her father had, previous to the
         trail, imposed silence on her. At length she heard the dreadful
         conclusion of the speech of the Public Accuser, which was but too
         faithful an omen of his fate. Pale, trembling, and ready to sink
         into the ground, she was only sustained by her father’s voice,
      </p>
      <img src="noble_044.jpg"></img>
      
      
      <p>Who in a low tone, pointing towards heaven, addressed to her a few
         words of consolation. But though calmed for the moment, when the
         sentence was about to be pronounced they found it necessary to
         remove her from the hall: and when so far removed that her groans
         could no longer be heard, she abandoned herself to a despair which
         baffles description. The unhappy girl had seen her father for the
         last time: she had breathed a portion of her feelings into every
         soul; and the deep sighs which arose from every corner of the court,
         when she was carried thence, were proofs of the homage due to filial
         virtue. Some humane persons followed her to the prison, where they
         found her in a swoon: on recovering herself, she begged to be taken
         to her father, that she might die with him. It was not until
         surrounded by her father's friends, and become a witness of their
         affliction, that her own sorrow could receive any mitigation, and
         the favourable moment was seized to lead her back to her family.

      <p>T<small>HE</small> heroism of Elizabeth Cazotte, which
         could not fail to excite the admiration and sympathy of her
         countrywomen, was imitated by many young persons, from similar
         impulses <img src="noble_045.jpg"></img>
          Of devoted affection. 
         <a name="#MDSombreuil"></a>Mademoiselle de Sombreuil
         claims a share of our esteem for the intrepdity she displayed, when,
         rushing into the presence of the murderers who had seized her father, she exclaimed as she
         fell at their feet, "Barbarians, hold your hands—he is my father!"
         In another moment she had so placed herself, that the sword could
         not reach father but through the heart of his child. Perceiving that
         they hesitated to accomplish their barbarous purpose, she
         supplicated once more, with renewed earnestness, that they would
         spare her father's life. Even while she spoke, one of the monsters,
         whose unfeeling heart was proof against the self-devotion and
         heroism of the lovely girl at his feet, annexed to her father's
         safety the following condition "Drink," said he, "a glass of
         blood,-- and save your father." Mademoiselle de Sombreuil
         shuddering, retreated several paces, but filial affection gained the
         ascendance, and she yielded to the horrible proposal.
      </p>
      
      <p>"Innocent or guilty then," said one of the judges who happened to be
         present, "it is unworthy of the people to bathe their hands in the
         blood of this old man, since they must first destroy this virtuous
         girl." A shout of "pardon! Pardon!" was heard from those who had
         difficulty refrained from tears. The daughter was clasped in her
         father’s trembling arms, and they left the prison together,
         conducted in triumph by those who had come for so very different a
         purpose.
      </p>
      
      <p>Sombreuil had further evils to encounter: <img src="noble_046.jpg"></img>
          he was shortly again arrested with his
         daughter, and led to prison. The latter had lost no portion of her
         courage, though she had been afflicted with frequent convulsions
         since the violence she had done to her feelings in drinking a glass
         of blood; and she displayed each moment fresh proofs of her filial
         attachment. When the order for her father’s trial arrived, although
         her heart was oppressed with the most afflicting presages, she
         maintained an appearance of composure before her parent, and to the
         last encouraged him to support himself with fortitude, whatever
         might occur. Sombreuil finally yielded up his life on the scaffold,
         when the existence of his daughter became a state worse than that of
         death.

      <p> When the ci-devant <a name="#MDBBeranger"></a>Marchioness de Bois
         Beranger was detained in the Luxembourg with her father, mother, and a younger sister, she forgot
         her own misfortunes in indeavouring to console her family under
         theirs. A soici- 
         <img src="noble_047.jpg"></img>
          Tude even maternal was displayed in
         her unceasing tenderness towards her mother, whose drooping
         fortitude was re-animated by her example. When at length the act of
         accusation arrived for her father, mother, and sister, Madame de
         Bois Beranger found that she alone was exempt: and the discovery of
         the mournful preference filled her with anguish. "You will die
         then," she exclaimed, "before me: and I am condemned to survive
         you." Overwhelmed with despair, she clung to those beloved
         relations, exclaiming, "Alas! Alas! We shall not die together!"
      </p>
      
      <p>In the midst of this moving scene, a second accusation arrived at the
         prison, in which the name of the marchioness was included. From this
         moment there were no more tears, no more exclamations of grief from
         this affectionate daughter. She flew to embrace her parents. "See,"
         she cried, as she displayed the act of accusation in joyful triumph,
         as though she held in her hand the decree of their liberty and her
         own, "see my mother,--we shall die together."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>On the day of execution she attired herself with elegance, and cut
         off the long tresses of her fine hair with her own hand. On leaving
         the Conciergerie to go to the scaffold, she supported her mother,
         who seemed to be overcome by an excess of grief. The sorrows of her
         parents appeared alone to be subjects of regret tot eh marchioness
         at this critical moment. “Dearest madam," she said in the tenderest
         accent, "be consoled: why are you not happy? You <img src="noble_048.jpg"></img>
          die innocent, and in the same
         innocence all your family follow you to the tomb, and will partake
         with you, in a better state, the recompense of virtue."

      <p><a name="#MDelleglace"></a>M<small>ADEMOISELLE</small>
          Delleglace
         was also a remarkable instance of filial affection. When her father was to be conveyed from
         the prison at Lyons to the
         Conciergerie, this affectionate girl, who from the first moment of
         his arrest never quitted him, demanded permission to travel with him
         in the carriage prepared for his journey. This boon she could not
         obtain; but what obstacles can subdue the strength of filial love?
         Laying aside the timidity natural to her sex, and wholly
         disregarding the weakness of her constitution, Mademoiselle
         Delleglace set out on foot with the carriage, which she accompanied
         in that manner for more than a hundred leagues. She sometimes
         quitted the side of the carriage, but it was only when she preceded
         her father, to procure proper nourishment for him in the towns
         through which they passed; and in the evening of every day, when she
         ran forward to beg of some charitable person a covering, to
         administer to her father's wants, in the dungeon where he must pass
         the night.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When at length they reached the gates of the Conciergerie, she was
         denied admittance with him, and compelled to give up the expec- <img src="noble_049.jpg"></img>
          tation of being his companion in
         prison. But her fortitude did not yet give way: she did not cease,
         during three months, to implore the justice and humanity of all
         those influential persons to whom she could gain access,
         perseverance was finally crowned with success; and exulting with
         joy, she hastened to bear the happy tidings to her father, and
         contemplated the delight of herself conducting him back to his home
         and family. But it was otherwise ordained: worn out by the excess of
         fatigue she had undergone during this unparalleled exertion, she was
         taken ill on the road and obliged to remain at an inn, until her
         father could be informed of the circumstance and be set at liberty.
         She never again left her bed, but died in her beloved parent's arms;
         still deeming herself happy in having purchased his life at the
         expense of her own.

         and lament the death of her

         escape observation; but her manner was at length noticed by some
         women who sold fruit near the spot. Being asked the cause of her
         tears, "Ah!" she said, <img src="noble_050.jpg"></img>
          "my poor mother, whom I loved so well,
         died where I now stand; but oh! do not, I beg of you, tell anyone
         that you saw me cry, for that, perhaps, would cause the death of my
         brother and my sisters." After this guileless answer, which greatly
         effected her audience, she hastily retired, and was never seen there
         again. It was afterwards known that this early victim of filial
         affection died in a few weeks, bowed down a grief which she could
         not cast off."

      <p>A<small>NOTHER</small>
         <a name="#CDaughter"></a>child was the happy means of
         saving her father's life.
         He was a Creole of
         St. Domingo, and was guilty
         of no other crime than that of being rich and preserving the
         inheritance of his forefathers. At that time when the contagious
         example of the French revolution had spread as far as the New World,
         the horrible practice was adopted of assembling in groupes the
         unfortunate victims who were ordered to be executed, and then firing
         l indiscriminately upon them with cannons loaded with grape-shot.
         The eyes of the Creole had been blindfolded, and he stood among a
         crowd of other unfortunate beings, expecting every instant the
         signal of death. When, however, the order to discharge artillery was
         about to be given, a little girl rushed forward, with a loud cry of
         "My <img src="noble_051.jpg"></img>
          "father! Oh my father! And making
         her way through the victims, threw her little arms about her
         parent’s neck, and waited for the moment of dying with him. In vain
         were all the threats of entreaties; neither the representations of
         her danger, nor the commands of her father could intimidate her. In
         reply to the latter, she earnestly repeated, "Oh! My father, let me
         die with you." What power has virtue over the most ferocious minds!
         This unexpected accident disconcerted the commander of the
         massacre:--doubtless he was a father too! The voice of admiration
         and exclamations of pity, which he heard from all sides, touched his
         heart, and under some specious pretext, the Creole was delivered
         from the expected punishment, and, accompanied by his child,
         reconducted to prison; whence he soon afterwards obtained his
         release. After that happy escape, he was often accustomed to relate,
         with feelings of tender emotion, the heroic action of his little
         girl, then only ten years of age.

      <p>D<small>DURING</small> the war of La Vendee, the ci-devant
          Duke de la Rochefoucault, condemned to die, as
         well as <a name="#MDRouchefoucault"></a>his daughter,
         found in the resources of that affectionate girl the means of
         concealing himself until a period arrived more favourable to that
         justice which he unsuccessfully claimed.
      </p>
      <img src="noble_052.jpg"></img>
      
      
      <p> His daughter's first care was
         to place him under the roof and protection of an artisan, who had
         formerly been a domestic in the duke's service, after which she
         procured an asylum for herself. They were thus both secure from the
         immediate power of their persecutors; but, as the duke’s property
         was confiscated, and compassion is apt to grow weary of its good
         offices, the means of their bare subsistence were soon exhausted.
         While the daughter was suffering under the extreme of poverty, she
         learnt that her father's health was rapidly declining for want of
         due nourishment. Madame de la Rochefoucault now saw but one resource left : to
         devote her own life to save that of her father ; and she instantly
         resolved upon the sacrifice.
      </p>
      
      <p>A general of the Republic happened at that time to be passing
         through the city in which was her place of concealment: she
         addressed the following letter to hi : "C<small>ITIZEN</small> G<small>ENERAL</small>: Wherever the
         voice of nature is heard, a daughter may be allowed to claim the
         compassion of men in behalf of her father. Condemned to death at the
         same time with him who Gave me being, I have successfully preserved
         him from the sword of the executioner, and have preserved myself to
         watch over his safety. But in saving his life, I have not been able
         to furnish all that is necessary to support him. My unhappy father,
         whose entire property is confiscated, suffers at this moment the
         want of almost every thing. Without clothes, without bread, without
         a <img src="noble_053.jpg"></img>
          Friend to save him from perishing of
         want, he has not even the resource of the beggar, which still
         furnishes a little hope, that of being able to appeal to the
         compassionate, and to present his white hairs to those that might be
         moved to give him aid: my father, if he is not speedily succoured,
         will die in his place of concealment, and thus, after snatching him
         from a violent death, I shall have to sustain the mournful
         reflection of having betrayed him to one more lingering and
         painful—that of dying of cold and hunger.
      </p>
      
      <p>"Be the judge, Citizen General, of the extent of my misfortune, and
         own that it is worthy of pity. One resource only is left to me: it
         is to cast myself upon your generosity. I offer you my head: I
         undertake to go, and to go willingly, to the scaffold; but give
         immediate succor to my dying father. Below I give you the name of my
         place of concealment, there I will expect death with pleasure, if I
         may promise myself that you will be touched with my prayers, and
         will relieve my old and destitute parent."

      <p>The soldier had no sooner read this letter, than he hastened to the
         asylum of Madame de Rochefoucault, and not only relieved her father,
         but secretly protected both, and finally produced the restoration of
         M. de Rochefoucault’s
         property by a revision of their sentence.

      <p>ELOQUENCE may sometimes effect its object by means of splendid images and
         sublime expressions, but that alone which springs from the heart takes
         the certain road to success. The flattering results which have on so
         many occasions attended the exercise of this brilliant talent by the
         female sex, must be rather attributed to the energetic zeal with which,
         from their goodness of heart, they have entered into the lists in
         defence of virtue, than to any was the custom with the public speakers
         of <img src=""></img>
          their times. The consciousness of being engaged
         in a virtuous cause has often given rise to the most enthusiastic and
         splendid eloquence on the part of women, who, weak and helpless by
         nature, have thus become endued with strength, not only to urge, but to
         accomplish the most arduous enterprises. There is no doubt that "If
         the mind with clear conception glow, The willing words in just
         expressions flow;" and warmth of feeling in women has amply
         compensated for any inferiority, if such there were, in their talents to
         those of the opposite sex. We ought to set much weight on these superior
         instances of mental capacity, and endeavour not to degenerate from such
         worthy examples: such patterns of merit should not be thrown away upon
         us; for they teach us that, if the too free use of speech is attributed
         as a failing to our sex, the proper use of that speech may be rendered
         not only a private but a public benefit; for, as there is a time to be
         silent, so it does sometimes happen that there is a time when it becomes
         a duty to speak, and eloquence, actuated by sincere and virtuous
         motives, must ever claim universal respect and admiration.

         permitted to depart, on condition that each mother, as a pledge of her
         return, should leave as a hostage, one of her children; the others were
         to be carried with them for the purpose of conciliating the Sabines.

          the feet of their fathers and brothers; when
         Hersilia, in the name of her companions, addressed the assembled chiefs
         in the following eloquent and pathetic harangue:— " ‘ What great injury
         have we done you that we have suffered, and still do suffer, so many
         miseries. We were carried off, by those who now have us, violently and
         illegally: after this violence, we were so long neglected by our
         brothers, our fathers, and our relations, that we were necessitated to
         unite in the strongest ties with those who were the objects of our
         hatred; and we are now brought to tremble for the men that had injured
         us so much, when we see them in danger, and to lament them when they
         fall, for you came not to deliver us from violence while virgins, or to
         avenge our cause; but now you tear the wives from their husbands, and
         the mothers from their children; an assistance more grievous to us than
         your neglect and disregard. Such love We experienced from them, and such
         compassion from you. Were the war undertaken in some other cause, yet
         surely you would stop its ravages for us, who have made you
         fathers-in-law and grand-fathers, or otherwise placed you in some near
         affinity to those whom you seek to destroy; but if the war be for us,
         take us, with your sons-in-law and their children, and restore us to our
         parents and kindred, lest we become captives again!' "The tears and
         remonstrances of Hersilia, added to the supplications of her companions,
         were rewarded by their countrymen consent- <img src="eloquence_005.jpg"></img>

         many honourable privileges and marks of distinction were conferred upon
         them, by unanimous consent, as testimonies of esteem for their conjugal
         and filial piety. A festival was also instituted to their honour, called
         Matronalia, in which the Roman matrons received presents from their
         husbands."

         began by seizing some fortresses. Happily for the new king, <a name="#Iphicrates"></a>Iphicrates was then in that country,
         whither the Athenians had sent him with a small fleet; and Eurydice,
         hearing of his arrival, besought him to pay her a visit, intending to

         that Amyntas father of these unhappy orphans, had always a love for your
         country, and adopted you for his son. This double tie lays you under a
         double obligation. The amity which that king entertained for Athens,

      <p>THE Celts, previous to their passing the Alps, and settling in Italy,
         were in such a state of irreconcilable contention and disunion, that a
         civil war was the consequence. When the opposing parties were on the
         point engaging in battle, the <a name="#CWomen"></a>women,
         placing themselves between the armies, took up the different points of
         dispute in to eloquent a manner, argued them so accurately, and
         determined so impartially, that a friendly correspondence <img src="eloquence_007.jpg"></img>
          was the result, and a civil and domestic peace
         finally established.
      </p>
      
      <p>From that time the Celts were accustomed, in any differences which arose
         between themselves and their allies, to appeal to the ladies to moderate
         between them, and always consulted their opinion respecting peace and
         war. In a subsequent league made with Hannibal, was inserted the
         following clause, a strong testimony of the respect which the female sex
         had, by their conduct, deservedly acquired from their countrymen. " If
         the Celts take occasion of quarrelling with the Carthaginians, the
         Colonels and Captains of the Carthaginians in Spain shall decide the
         controversies; bet if the Carthaginians accuse the Celts, the Celtic
         women shall be the judges."

         <a name="#Cornelia"></a>Cornelia, daughter of the great
         <a name="#Scipio"></a>Scipio, whose taste and learning
         were fully displayed in her letters, which were then in the hands of the
         public: and <a name="#Cicero"></a>Cicero, the greatest orator Rome ever produced, says, "We
         have read the letters of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchii, from
         which it appears that the sons were educated, not so much in the lap of
         their mother, as her conversation."

      <img src="eloquence_008.jpg"></img>
      
      
      
      <p>“ Cornelia's extraction was the noblest in Rome and her family was the
         richest; yet it was not either her birth or fortune which rendered her
         memory immortal, but the virtuous example which she gave in her own
         conduct countrywomen and posterity. The following interesting anecdote
         is recorded of Cornelia and although foreign to the present subject well
         deserves our attention. A lady of Compania, coming to make her a visit,
         and lodging in her house displayed with pomp whatever was then most
         fashionable and valuable for the toilet, gold and silver, jewels,
         diamonds, bracelets and pendants, and all the apparatus which the
         ancients called mundum muliebrem, (woman’s world.) She expected to find
         somewhat still finer in the house of a person of her quality, and
         desired very importunately to see her toilet. Cornelia artfully
         prolonged the conversation till such a time as her children came home,
         who were then gone to the public schools, and pointing to them as they
         entered, ‘See here,’ says she, ‘are my jewels.’ Et heac, inquit,
         ornamenta mea sunt.’ “
      </p>
      
      <p>“We need only," observes M. de Rollin, “examine our own thought, in
         relation to those two ladies, to find out how far superior the noble
         simplicity of the one was to the vain magnificence of the other; and,
         indeed, what merit or ability is there in buying up a large collection
         of precious stones and jewels, in being vain of them, or in not knowing
         how to talk of any thing else. And on the other, how truly worthy is it,
         in a person of <img src="eloquence_009.jpg"></img>
          the first quality, to be above such trifles, to
         place her honour and glory in the good education of her children, in
         sparing no expense towards the bringing it about, and in showing that
         nobleness and greatness of soul to equally belong to both sexes."

      <p>" <a name="#Hortensia"></a>HORTENSIA, a celebrated Roman
         lady, exemplified the power of eloquence over the human mind. Her father

         celebrated orator of his time, and his talents were inherited by his
         daughter. The triumvirs had obliged 4,000 women to give upon oath, an
         account of their possessions, to defray the expenses of the state; and
         the Roman ladies in this emergency had recourse to Hortensia, who
         undertook to plead their cause, and accompanied them to the tribunal of
         the triumvirs, where she made a speech in their name to the following
         effect:— " ‘ My lords, these unhappy ladies whom you see here, imploring
         your justice and bounty, would never have presumed to appear in this
         place, had they not first made use of all possible means, which either
         their native modesty, might allow, or their best understanding could
         inform them of. Though our appearing here may seem contrary to the <img src="eloquence_010.jpg"></img>
          rules of decency prescribed to our sex, which we
         have hitherto most strictly observed, yet the loss of our fathers, our
         children, our brothers, and our husbands is sufficient to excuse us;
         nay, and to vindicate us too, when their unhappy deaths are made a
         pretence for our farther misfortunes. You pretend that you have been
         affronted, but what have the women done that they must be impoverished?
         If they are as blameable as the men, why you not proscribe them too?
         Certainly none of our sex have ever declared you your country's enemies;
         we have neither plundered your goods, nor suborned your soldiers; we
         have raised no troops against you, nor opposed those honours and offices
         to which you pretend.—We presume not to govern the republic, nor is it
         our ambition which has drawn the present miseries and misfortunes on our
         heads; empire, dignities, and honours we never designed for our sex. We,
         alas! have done nothing to affront you, nothing to offend you, nor any
         thing to move you to this severe treatment of us. But you tell us, that
         you have a war to support, and when have mankind been free from war? and
         yet, have women ever been taxed on that account? The universal consent
         of nations has confirmed an exception in their favour, which nature
         herself has granted us. Formerly, indeed, the Roman women, in the
         extreme exigency of the republic, when in danger of becoming a prey to
         the Carthaginians, contributed towards the expenses of the state, but it
         was volunta- <img src="eloquence_011.jpg"></img>
          rily; that which they gave was not levied upon
         their estates, dowries, and houses, they only appropriated to it the
         ornaments of their persons; nor were they subject to any estimation, or
         informations of accusers. What is then the danger which you apprehend at
         present? Do the Gauls or Parthians invade Italy? In that case you will
         find us no less generous than our mothers; but think not that we will
         contribute our estates to maintain civil wars, and enable you to destroy
         one another. Such a demand was never made either by <a name="#Caesar"></a>Caesar or <a name="#Pompey"></a>Pompey in their wars; nor by <a name="#Marius"></a>Marius and <a name="#Cinna"></a>Cinna
         during their cruelties; no, not by Sylla himself who first set up
         tyranny in Rome: yet after all you adorn yourselves with the glorious
         title of reformers of the state.'

      <p>"This discourse appeared so bold and dangerous, to the triumvirs, that
         they immediately sent their lictors to cause the ladies to retire, but
         perceiving that the multitude began to cry out against such violence,
         they promised to reconsider the affair, and afterwards drew up another
         list of 400 women instead of 4,000; but to make good the sum they
         wanted, they taxed all the citizens and foreigners, without distinction,
         who were worth one hundred thousand drachmas, or upwards of 3200 pounds
         sterling."

         and with such sorrow mourn’d” <a name=""></a>Wordsworth,</q>
      
      
      <p><a name="#Agrippina"></a>AGRIPPINA, wife of the renowned
         <a name="#Germanicus"></a>Germanicus, deserves to he
         mentioned among most illustrious of her sex. The princess was
         distinguished by her conjugal as well as maternal affection. Upon the
         death of her husband, she conveyed his ashes from Antioch to Rome. She
         disembarked at Brundusiem where all the friends of her family, and the
         officers who had served under Germanicus, with many others, had
         assembled to receive her. "As soon as the fleet was in sight, not only
         the port and shore, but the walls and roofs, and every place whence the
         sea could be viewed were crowded with spectators, who were uncertain
         whether to receive this truly noble woman with silence or
         acclamation.
      </p>
      
      <p>Agrippina appeared, and landed, carrying the sepulchral urn, with her
         eyes immoveably cast down, accompanied by two of her children: One
         general burst of sorrow from the assembled multitude, bespoke their
         sympathy in her sufferings, and bore testimony to the many virtues of
         their brave and beloved general. The urn, placed on a litter, was
         carried on the shoulders of tribunes and centurions, and, in all the
         colonies through which it passed, received universal tokens of funeral
         grief. In this manner were the remains of Germanicus conveyed to the
         tomb of Augustus, where they were deposited by his mourning wife." But
         great as was the conjugal virtue of Agrip- <img src="eloquence_013.jpg"></img>
          ina, it does not relate to our present subject.
         An instance of her eloquence and enthusiastic spirit is recorded which
         more properly claims our attention in this place.
      </p>
      
      <p><a name="#CPulchra"></a>Claudia Pulchra, a near relation of
         Agrippina, had been falsely accused of a design poison the Emperor, and
         the prosecution against her had commenced. The prospect her friend's
         danger aroused the spirit of illustrious Agrippina. " She rushed to the
         presence of <a name="#Tiberius"></a>Tiberius. Finding him
         in the act of offering a sacrifice to the manes of <a name="#Augustus"></a>Augustus, she accosted him in a tone of
         vehemence. 'The piety,' she said, ' which thus employs itself in slaying
         victims to the deceased Emperor, agrees but ill with the hatred that
         persecutes his posterity. Those are senseless statues which you adore;
         they are not animated with the spirit of Augustus. His descendants are
         living images of him; and yet, even they, whose veins are warm with his
         celestial blood, stand trembling on the brink of peril. Why is Claudia
         Pulchra devoted to destruction? What has she committed? She has loved
         Agrippina, to excess has loved her; that is her only crime. Improvident
         woman! she might have remembered Sosia, undone and ruined for no other
         reason.' “
      </p>
      
      <p>This spirited appeal of the Princess did not meet with the success it
         merited, for Tiberius had indeed resolved on the ruin of Agrippina and
         her family. Pulchra was condemned, and <img src="eloquence_014.jpg"></img>
          her fate was but the forerunner of that to
         unfortunate widow of Germanicus.

      <p>"In the year 1172, the city of Ancona, situated on the Adriatic Sea, and
         on that count a place of great importance, the possession of it
         affording an entrance into Italy, was besieged by the Venetians under
         the command of the Archbishop of Mayence. 
      </p>
      
      <p>"After a very brave defence, the distressed inhabitants were reduced to
         such an extremity by famine, that they sent deputies to the Archbishop,
         offering him an immense sum of money to raise the siege; but he refused
         them with insult, saying, " It would be folly to accept a part, when the
         whole was in his power.” The deputies made him a spirited reply, but
         returned disheartened to the city. In the consultations which followed,
         some were for submitting unconditionally as was demanded and others
         preferred dying sword in hand. An old man, who had lived more than a
         century, reanimated their courage, by proposing the employment of their
         treasures in procuring succours from the neighbouring Princes; and then,
         if their applications prove fruitless, he advised them to throw their
         riches <img src="eloquence_015.jpg"></img>
          into the sea, and sell their lives as dear as
         possible.
      </p>
      
      <p>Deputies were accordingly sent by some stratagem, through the Venetian
         fleet, to <a name="#WAdelardi"></a>William degli Adelardi,
         of Ferrara, and the Count, of Bertinoro, who engaged in the cause with
         all that zeal and alacrity which animate generous minds to aid the
         distressed.
      </p>
      
      <p>“The Archbishop, alarmed at the succours he heard were preparing for the
         besieged, caused letters as from their deputies to be thrown into the
         city, saying, that their negotiations had been unsuccessful, and that
         they must expect no help. Some of the most enlightened of the
         inhabitants detected the forgery, and calmed the anxious minds of the
         affrighted populace, by solemnly assuring them they were false. In the
         mean time, through many difficulties and interruptions the troops of the
         <a name="#CAlrude"></a> Countess Aldrude and William
         Adelardi, advanced, preceded by a standard of cloth of gold. They were
         composed of twelve squadrons, each consisting of two hundred choice men;
         and an innumerable multitude of regular and light infantry. They
         encamped upon a hill, not far from the Archbishop; and when it was
         night, Adelardi ordered his men to place two or more lighted candles
         upon the tops of their pikes and lances. Alarmed, by this means, with
         the idea that their number was immense, the Archbishop 'drew bark a
         little from the city, to secure a height, that nature had rendered very
         strong.
      </p>
      
      <img src="eloquence_016.jpg"></img>
      
      
      
      <p>“William harangued his army, who heard him with loud applause; and, at
         the close of his speech, Aldrude also came forward, and addressed the
         assembled soldiers in the following manner: "'Encouraged and fortified
         by the favour and mercy of Heaven, I have resolved, contra, to the
         general usage of women, to speak to you here, because I hope to say,
         something that may be useful, though unadorned with the figures of
         eloquence, and the reasonings of philosophy. It often happens that a
         simple discourse acts upon the mind, while one more laboured merely
         pleases the ear. It is neither a love of power, nor worldly advantage,
         which has led me here. Since the death of my husband, I reign, with an
         aching heart, over all his domains, without any contest. It is enough
         for me to keep what I possess. What animates me, is the miserable
         situation of Ancona, the tears of its ladies, who fear to fall into the
         power of the besiegers. Need I enter into the detail? It is to succour
         men, worn by famine, fatigued by frequent combats, exposed constantly,
         to new toils, to new dangers, that I come, with my only son, who, though
         a child, inherits his father's greatness of soul, and shows the same
         courage and the same zeal for the protection and defence of his friends.
         And you, warriors of Lombardy and Romagna, who are no less distinguished
         for your fidelity than your valour, the same cause brings you here. You
         obey the orders and imitate the example of William Adelardi, who,
         listening only to his <img src="eloquence_017.jpg"></img>
          natural generosity and love of freedom, has
         hazarded his own fortune, and that of his friends and vassals, for the
         deliverance of Ancona. I know not how to praise him as I ought, because
         language is not equal to the expression of our thoughts and wishes! We
         become truly virtuous only when we prize virtue more than wealth and
         honour! This glorious enterprise has as yet succeeded, since you have
         passed through countries occupied be your enemies. But it is now time
         that the seed should produce fruit. It is time to make a trial of your
         strength, since you have occasion to make a trial of your courage.
         Hence, then, without delay, which enfeebles the minds of most men. Be
         under arms at the first break of day, no that the rising sun ma beam
         upon the victory, which the Most High promises to your charity. May my
         prayers draw down a blessing upon you; and may the sight of those
         beautiful ladies who accompany me, animate you! If knights are
         accustomed to display their skill and strength in cruel combats, for
         pleasure only; if they expose their lives in honour of scarce-remembered
         beauty; how much more ought you to make efforts for the victory! You,
         who by the motive of your enterprise alone augment the glory of your
         name, and acquire the esteem of the world! Let not your hands spare the
         rebels! Be your swords bathed in the blood of those who resist!
         Indulgence is not for those who, whilst they can do evil, will not
         pardon.'

      <p>"The troops were greatly animated by eloquent appeal to their feelings,
         and they felt prepared for victory. No battle, however, was fought. The
         Archbishop fled during the night, and all the citizens came to re thanks
         to Aldrude and Adelardi, and to offer them the most magnificent
         presents.

         for the wardship of a certain person, challenging it as her right,
         boldly told him 'that he was constituted by God Almighty to govern his
         people, but that he neither governed himself nor his subjects as he
         ought to do;' adding, that he wronged the church and oppressed the
         nobles.' To which the King answered, ‘ Have the peers framed a charter,
         and appointed you their advocate to speak for them, by reason of your
         eloquence?' ‘No,' said this spirited woman, but you have violated that
         charter of liberties which your father did grant, and which you obliged
         yourself by oath <img src="eloquence_019.jpg"></img>
          to perform; thus, you are a notorious infringer
         of your faith and oath. What is become of these liberties of England, so
         solemnly recorded, so often confirmed, and so dearly purchased? I,
         though a woman, with all the freeborn people of this realm, do appeal to
         the tribunal of God against you. Heaven and earth shall bear witness how
         injuriously you have dealt with us, and the Avenger of perjury will
         protect the justice of our cause.' As the King was conscious of the
         breach of his promise, he beheld with admiration the undaunted conduct
         of the Countess; and, being checked by her stately demeanour, and severe
         reproof, said, 'Do you deserve my favour, kinswoman?' To which she
         replied, ‘Since you have denied me that which is right, what reason have
         Ito hope for your favour? I do, in the presence of Christ, appeal
         against those who have by evil counsels misled you from justice and
         truth, for their private ends.' "

         in a way so contrary to what the lawyers call practice, (their

         than once interfered to remind the fair pleader, how little she was
         speaking to the purpose, mixing with his admonitions art expression of
         regret that she had not intrusted her defence to some gentleman of the
         bar, who would have known how to conduct it? Miss Tucker (obstinate
         woman) was not to be turned from her own way; she had nothing to gain by
         mere deference to the opinion of the judge; all she wanted, all she
         hoped for, and all she was striving for, was to gain her own cause. The
         judge (charitable in vain!) abandoned her to her fate; and when she had
         done 'talking to no purpose,' charged the jury in a sense by no means
         favourable to her acquittal. The jury brought in a verdict of not

         distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear; I have so

      <q> “What rhetoric didst thou use To gain this mighty boon?" <a name="#OCromwell"></a>Oliver Cromwell.</q>
      
      
      <p>"<a name="#OCromwell"></a>Oliver Cromwell was one day
         engaged in a warm argument with a lady upon the subject of oratory, in
         which she maintained that eloquence could only be acquired by those who
         made it their study in early life, and their practice afterwards. The
         Lord Protector on the contrary, maintained that there was no eloquence
         but that which sprung from the heart; since, when that was deeply int in
         the attainment of any object, it never failed to supply a fluency and
         richness of expression which wouls1, in the comparison, render vapid the
         studied speeches of the most celebrated orators.
      </p>
      
      <p>"This argument ended, as most arguments do, in the lady's tenaciously
         adhering to her side of the question, and the Protector's saying, 'he
         had no doubt he should one day her a convert to his opinion.'
      </p>
      
      <p>“Some days after the lady was thrown in a state bordering on distraction,
         by the unexpected arrest and imprisonment of her husband who was
         conducted to the Tower as traitor to the government.
      </p>
      
      <p>“The agonized wife flew to the Lord Protector, rushed through his guards,
         threw herself at his feet, and with the most pathetic eloquence pleaded
         for the life and innocence of her husband.
      </p>

      <p>“Cromwell maintained a severe brow, until The petitioner, overpowered by
         the excess of her feelings, and the energy with which she had expressed
         them, paused. His stern countenance then relaxed into a smile, and
         extended to her an immediate liberation of her husband, he said, 'I
         think all who have witnessed this scene will vote on my side of the
         question, in the dispute between us the other day, that eloquence of the
         heart alone has power to save.’ “
      </p>
      
      <q>“She studied not the meanest to eclipse, And the wisest listened to
         her lips; She sang not, knew not, music’s magic skill, But yet her voice
         had tones that sway 'd the will." <a name=""></a>CAMPBELL.</q>
      
      
      <p>“<a name="#KAugustus"></a>KING AUGUSTUS of Poland being
         desirous of entering secretly into a treaty of peace with <a name="#KCharlesVII"></a>Charles the Twelfth of Sweden,
         intrusted the affair to the <a name="#CKongigsmark"></a>Countess of
         Konigsmark, a Swedish lady of high birth, to whom he was
         at that time attached.
      </p>
      
      <p> "This lady, celebrated in the world for her wit and beauty, was more
         capable than any minister to bring a negotiation to a happy conclusion.
         Moreover, as she had an estate in the dominions of Charles XII., and had
         lived a long time in his court, she had a plausible pretext to seek this
         prince. She therefore went to the Swedish camp in Lithuania, and
         addressed <img src="eloquence_026.jpg"></img>
          herself directly to Count Piper, who too
         hastily, promised her an audience with his master. The Countess, among
         those perfections which rendered her one of the most amiable women in
         Europe, had the singular talent of speaking the languages of several
         countries which she had never seen, with as much delicacy as if she had
         been born there; she even amused herself sometimes in writing French
         verses which might have been mistaken for the production of a person
         born at Versailles. Those she composed for Charles XII. history ought
         not to omit. She introduced the heathen gods, praising the different
         virtues of Charles. The piece concluded thus:— 
         
         " Enfin, chacun des dieux discourant á sa gloire, 
         Le plaçait par avance au temple de Memoire;
         Mais Venus ni Bacchus n’en dirent pas un mot.'
         
         
         
         “ ‘ Nay, all the gals to sound his fame combine,
         Except the deities of Love and Wine.'
         
         
         
      </p>
      
      <p> "All her wit and beauty were, however, thrown away, upon a man such as
         the king of Sweden, who constantly refused to see her. She therefore
         resolved to throw herself in his way, as he rode out to take the air,
         which he frequently did. She one day met him in a narrow path; she
         descended from her carriage as soon as she perceived him: the king made
         lice a low ban, turned his horse about, and rale back in an instant. And
         thus the only <img src="eloquence_027.jpg"></img>
          Advantage which the Countess of Konigsmark
         gained from her journey was the satisfaction of believing that the king
         of Sweden feared nobody but her.”
