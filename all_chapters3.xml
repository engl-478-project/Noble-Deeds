                        <p>T<hi rend="smallCaps">HE</hi> pleasure experienced by the author in perusing the scattered records
                            of female excellence, gave rise to the idea that an interesting
                            selection might be made from them, and prove not only instructive but
                            useful. The acknowledged superiority of example over precept confirmed
                            this opinion, and the ensuing narratives have been chosen as most
                            suitable to the various conditions and trials of life.</p>

                        <p>Woman,&#8212; to whose fostering care the direction of infaney is
                            intrusted,&#8212; to whom manhood is indebted for mental recreations and
                            for consolation in difficulties,&#8212; upon whom also man, in declining
                            years depends for solace and support,&#8212; too often betrays her
                            incapacity to fulfil the important duties she is called upon to
                            undertake. When thus circumstanced she frequently fails in the
                            performance of a mother's tender obligations, and she not only loses the
                            affections, but sinks in the estimation, of her husband; &#8212;, or
                            immersed in the dissipations of society, she neglects to attend to those
                            more sacred offices on which even her own happiness depends. To the just
                            fulfillment of these, it is <pb facs="noble_003.jpg"/> necessary she should think, feel, and
                            act correctly; yet this cannot be expected while the ornamental
                            accomplishments now cultivated with so much care, are allowed to
                            supersede the more valuable acquirements. Painting, music, and dancing
                            mauy afford agreeable recreation, but they must ever yield to the more
                            important pursuits of life; the strict observance of the duties imposed
                            on mother, daughter, sister, wife, and friend, commands the esteem and
                            respect of others, and confers lasting happiness on ourselves. In the
                            discharge of these how delightful to contemplate the examples of a
                                    <name><persName>Cornelia</persName></name>, a
                                    <name><persName>Lady Russel</persName></name>, and an
                                    <name><persName>Elizabeth Cazotte</persName></name>!</p>
                        <p>The performance of the domestic obligations, which are more calculated to
                            court the esteem of the few than to excite the admiration of many, is
                            the natural province of the sex: but Woman's sphere of action is not, at
                            all times, to be so circumscribed: her intergrity, fortitude, courage,
                            and presence of mind, may frequently be called forth by adventitious
                            circumstances. In extraordinary times, as those in which we live, she
                            may be placed in situations of difficultly, if not danger: let her then
                            prepare herself to encounter them, by studying the examples now
                            presented for her contemplation. Then, should her integrity be
                            questioned, she may imitate that of the <name><persName>Duchess de
                                    Longueville</persName></name>; &#8212; should afflications
                            overtake her, she may learn fortitute from <name><persName>Madame
                                    Roland</persName></name>; &#8212; should unexpected dangers
                            await her, she may acquire courage and presence of mind from the conduct
                            <pb facs="noble_004.jpg"/>
                            of <name><persName>Maragaret of Anjou</persName></name>; &#8212;
                            and should the hour of trail occur, <placeName>Britain</placeName> will
                            find her not deficient in patriotism: her trinkets and money will then,
                            like those of the ladies of <name><placeName>France</placeName></name>
                            and <name><placeName>Rome</placeName></name>, be laid on the altar of
                            the her country. Her's will be the NOBLE DEEDS OF WOMAN! by uniting the
                            sublime virtue of patriotism with the sublime virtue of patriotism with
                            the exercise of every domestic and social duty! </p>

                                    <settlement type="province" subtype="chiefdom"
                                    >Xaragua</settlement>, to rise upon the Spaniards; and he "set
                                out for that prodvince, at the head of three hundred foot soldiers,
                                armed with swords, arquebuses, and crossbows, and seventy horsemen,
                                with cuirasses, bucklers, and lances. He pretended that he was going
                                on a mere visit to Anacaona, and to make an arrangement about the
                                payment of tribute.</p>
                            <p>"When Anacaona heard of this intended visit, she sent to all her

                                head of his little army, approached, she went forth to meet him,
                                according to the custom of her nation, attended by a great train of
                                her most distinguished subjects, male and female. They received the
                                Spaniards with the popular areytos, their national songs; the young
                                women waving palm branches, and dancing before them.</p>
                            <p>"Anacaona treated the governor with that natural graciousness and
                                dignity for which she was celebrated. She gave him the largest house
                                in the place for his residence, and his people were quartered in the
                                houses adjoining. For several days the Spaniards were entertained
                                with all the natural luxuries that the province afforded. National
                                songs and dances, and games, were performed for their amusement, and
                                there was every outward demonstration of the same hospitality, the
                                same amity, that Anacaona had uniformly shown to white men.</p>
                            <p>"Notwithstanding all this kindness, Ovando being persuaded that
                                Anacaona secretly meditated a massacre of himself and his followers,
                                resolved to anticipate the supposed plot by a counter-artifice, and
                                to overwhelm this defenceless people in an indiscriminate and bloody
                                vengeance.</p>
                            <p>"He accordingly invited the Indians, in return, to witness certain
                                national games of his country; and amongst other diversions was to
                                be a tilting match, or joust with reeds, and all the Spaniards were

                                signal of their commander.</p>
                            <p>Anacaona, with her daughter, attendants, and all the caciques, were
                                assembled in a house which commanded a view of the square in which
                                the joust was to take place. "Ovando, perceiving that every thing
                                was disposed according to his orders, gave the fatal signal. The
                                house was surrounded and no one permitted to escape. The Spaniards
                                entered, and seizing upon the caciques, bound them to the posts
                                which supported the roof. Anacaona was led forth a prisoner. The
                                unhappy caciques were then put to horrible tortures, until some of
                                them, in the extremity of anguish, were made to accuse the queen and
                                themselves of the plot with which they were charged. When this cruel
                                mockery of judicial form had been executed, instead of preserving
                                them for after-examination, fire was set to the house, and all the
                                caciques perished miserably in the flames." </p>
                            <p>Mean while a most horrid massacre took place without; the armed
                                horseman, sparing neither age nor sex, put the defenceless throng to
                                an indiscriminate slaughter, and the princess Anacaona was carried
                                in chains to San Domingo. "The mockery of a trial," continues the
                                historian, "was given her, in which she was found guilty, on the
                                confessions which had been wrung by tortures, from her subjects, and
                                on the testimony of their butchers; and she was ignominiously

                                comprehended at once that a poor refugee was in distress: though she
                                did not understand one word of English, she followed Mr. Hamilton to
                                the spot where he had left Colonel Stuart, who addressed her in her
                                native tongue, and as his case was desperate, confided to her their
                                names and their peril. She told him the cattle were pasturing near
                                her cottage; but if he would wait a little, she would send the herds
                                out of view, and get him removed without exciting suspicion. Having
                                succeeded in this, she kept them concealed for several days; and
                                when they at length quitted their humane preserver, she loaded them
                                with provisions, accompanied them for several miles, pointing out
                                the unfrequented paths, or where they might venture to ask for a
                                lodging, refusing at the same time the slightest remuneration. What
                                adds to the merit of the action, is that the poor widow had lost two
                                sons in the king’s cause, to which she was strongly attached."</p>

                            <p>"After the battle of <settlement type="village"
                                >Culloden</settlement>, immense numbers of officers and men received
                                refreshments from <persName ref="#MGordon">Mrs. Gordon</persName>,
                                and every part of the manse, except one room, was filled with the
                                wounded. To guard against treachery, Mrs. Gordon lodged the
                                fugitives in separate apartments. So cautiously did she conceal from
                                each, the condition of the others, that the first request was, that
                                they would not intrust her with their real names: she could serve
                                them under a fictitious appellation. In this manner a father and son
                                were five months under her roof, without knowing their proximity.
                                Colonel Stuart, being a native of the neighbouring country, was
                                personally known, and, with his usual impetuosity, had introduced
                                his friend Mr. Hamilton, before Mrs. Gordon could ask him to give
                                only a borrowed name. However, she said, the gentleman must in
                                future assume the designation of Mr. Milton, and the colonel himself
                                must be Mr. Grey. She gave separate chambers to each, and as Colonel
                                Stuart was the most obnoxious to government, the window of his room
                                allowed a speedy retreat to the lake, where a boat was constantly in
                                waiting, to facilitate his escape to the upper district of
                                    <settlement type="district">Badenoch</settlement>, in case of a
                                close pursuit by the military stationed all around, to intercept the
                                outlaws. In a few days Colonel Stuart found he must betake himself
                                to his friends in the mountains; but the inquest in that quarter be-

                                hearing music and dancing, he got in at the window of his own room
                                and went to bed. He had been two days and three nights without rest,
                                sometimes hidden in caverns, sometimes even obliged to strip and
                                plunge into a bog, covering his head with branches of birch, which
                                he carried for the express purpose; and sometimes, like Charles the
                                Second, he eluded his pursuers by ascending a tree. He was now
                                disposed to sleep soundly, little suspecting that several officers
                                were in the house. Mrs. Gordon had heard they were in search of
                                Colonel Stuart. She hoped he was far off, but trembled for other
                                guests; and the ready expedient of collecting some young people, and
                                appearing heedlessly merry, she knew would divert suspicion. The
                                officers, in place of ransacking the manse, joined the merry
                                dancers, and went away after supper, convinced that a family so
                                jovial could have no concealments. Some of the company were to sleep
                                at the manse. Mrs. Gordon had then no spare room, except that
                                occupied by her daughter; but she made as many beds as the floor
                                could contain, and the young lady with her cousin were removed to
                                Mr. Grey’s room. They undressed. One of them attempted to raise the
                                bedclothes, when Colonel Stuart awoke. He had loaded pistols, and
                                his sword unsheathed always beside him when he lay down to rest.
                                Providentially the sword came first to hand. The candle had been
                                extinguished, but a gleam of the moon showed a <pb

                                thrust. Had Colonel Stuart seized the pistol, it must have been too
                                late to recognize the daughter of his benefactress. The shock of a
                                bare possibility of taking her life, he said, was more overwhelming
                                than all his past misfortunes. She was Mrs. Gordon’s only
                                child."</p>
                            <p>Colonel Stuart pays the following tribute to the female sex: "In all
                                our wanderings," says he, "we have preferred applying to the gentler
                                sex. They never rejected us; and, if they could contribute to
                                providing for our safety, after separating from them, we found they
                                had a quick and clear perception of the means, and sympathy to
                                stimulate their exertions, and to render them effectual. Even
                                ladies, who were keen partisans of the House of Hanover, spared
                                neither trouble nor expense in our behalf."</p>

                                two hours; during which time his majesty was apprized that a white
                                man, poorly equipped was about to pass the river, to seek an
                                audience. A chief was immediately sent, with an express order that
                                the traveler should not cross without his majesty’s permission, and
                                pointed to a village at some distance, where it was recommended that
                                the stranger should pass the night. Park, not a little disconcerted,
                                repaired to the village; but as the order had not been accompanied
                                with any provision for his reception, he found every door shut.
                                Turning his horse loose to graze, he was preparing, as a security
                                from wild beasts, to climb a tree and sleep among the branches, when
                                a beautiful and affecting incident occurred, which gives a most
                                pleasing view of the negro character. An old woman returning from
                                the labours of the field, cast on him a look of compassion, and
                                desired him to follow her. She led him to an apartment in her hut,
                                procured a fine fish, which she broiled for his supper, and spread a
                                mat for him to sleep upon. She then desired her maidens, who had
                                been gazing in fixed astonishment at the white man, to resume their
                                tasks, which they continued to ply through a great part of the
                                night. They cheered their labours with a song, which must have been

                                also for his friend Salles. The news of this unexpected relief being
                                carried to three companies of the proscribed Deputies, they
                                determined to beg this courageous woman to permit them to share in

                                in a few hours with the answer. Madame Bouquet invited them to come;
                                but, at the same time, recommended them not to approach her house
                                till midnight, and to take every possible precaution not to be
                                perceived by anyone; their safety in her house, which was what
                                occupied her thoughts, depended greatly on these preliminary
                                conditions.</p>
                            <p>"They arrived at midnight. They found their friends lodged thirty
                                feet under ground, in a large vault, the entrance to which was so
                                concealed that it was impossible for a person ignorant of the
                                circumstance to perceive it.</p>
                            <p>"The continual residence of five men in this cellar, although it was
                                very spacious, rendered the air so corrupt that, as it could not be
                                renewed but with great difficulty, Madame Bouquet contrived, in
                                another part of the house, a second asylum, more healthy, and almost
                                as secure. A few days afterwards, Buzot and Petion informed them by
                                letter, that having within fifteen days changed their place of
                                retreat seven times, they were now reduced to the greatest distress.
                                'Let them both come,' exclaimed this generous woman.</p>
                            <p>"All this time not a day passed without Madame Bouquet being menaced
                                with a domiciliary visit, not a day in which the guillotine did not
                                lay some heads in the dust. Too generous not to be liable to
                                suspicion, this heroic woman each day heard the satellites of
                                tyrrany swear, as they passed her habitation, that they would burn
                                alive in their houses all <pb facs="noble_020.jpg" n="53"/>

                                Deputies.</p>
                            <p>"'Well,' said she, 'let these inquisitors come. I am contented,
                                provided you do not take upon yourselves to receive them; all that
                                fear is, that they will arrest me, and then&#8212;what will become
                                of you?'</p>
                            <p>"Petion and Buzot arrived, and then there were seven of them. The
                                difficulty to provide for them was great, provisions being extremely
                                scarce in the department. Madame Bouquet’s house was allowed by the
                                municipality only one pound of bread per day; but, fortunately, she
                                had a stock of potatoes and dried kidney-beans. To save breakfast,
                                it was agreed that her guests should not rise till noon. Vegetable
                                soup was their whole dinner. After the day had closed, the Deputies
                                silently and cautiously left their retreat, and assembled round
                                their benefactress. She was in the midst of them as a mother among
                                her children, for whom she devotes her life. Sometimes a morsel of
                                beef, procured with great difficulty, an egg or two, some
                                vegetables, and a little milk, formed the supper, of which the
                                hostess ate but little, however entreated, the better to support her
                                guests.</p>
                            <p>"A month stole away in this peaceful security, with which was mingled
                                the sweet enjoyment of generous affection and grateful friendship;
                                when the Deputies, having some unusual reason to fear for the safety
                                of their benefactress, forcibly expressed to her their appre- <fw>

                                long?' replied this admirable woman, ‘having given you shelter? And
                                is not death all that is to be desired, when one has done all the
                                good possible?'</p>
                            <p>"A circumstance which adds infinite value to this generosity was,
                                that Madame Bouquet carefully concealed from her guests the
                                uneasiness which secretly consumed her, occasioned by one of her
                                relations, who had formerly been the intimate friend of Guadet. This
                                man having learned what passed in Madame Bouquet’s house, set in
                                action every means his mind could suggest, composed of falsehoods
                                and artifices, the fruits of a pusillanimous temper and a miserable
                                self-love, to induce her to banish the fugitives from her house.
                                Every day he came to her with stories more terrible one than
                                another. Sometimes he declared that he felt himself bound to
                                denounce traitors put out of the sanction of the law; and then he
                                would affect strong remonstrances in behalf of a family endangered
                                by her imprudent conduct. He sometimes acted as if his mind was
                                disordered by the terrors that, on her account, he indulged in; and,
                                at length, fearing that he would take some sudden and desperate
                                measure, endangering the lives of the Deputies, she felt it justice
                                to them, to lay her situation before them. Her voice was almost
                                stifled with grief as she spoke to them.</p>
                            <p>"There was but one course for the Deputies to take; they resolved to
                                quit their happy and peaceful asylum, and the moment of their
                                separation, so mournful to all, and so fatal and <pb

                            <p>"Suspected of having afforded an asylum to the fugitive deputies, it
                                was not long before Madame Bouquet was arrested, together with the
                                whole family of Guadet. It was well known with what tenderness and
                                ingenuity the father of that Deputy sought to save his son, who,
                                with his friend Salles, had taken refuge under his roof. Carried
                                before the Revolutionary Tribunal of <settlement type="city"
                                    >Bourdeaux</settlement>, his judges were too prudent to question
                                this venerable man concerning the concealment of his son; even they
                                dreaded the touching voice of nature, and the indignation of virtue.
                                He was simply asked why he had given asylum to Salles; to which the
                                old man answered by clasping his hands, and raising them to Heaven.
                                Witness of this afflicting scene, Madame Bouquet, as vehement in her
                                indignation as she had been impassioned in her protection of the
                                Deputies, had not power to listen in silence to such an
                                interrogatory.</p>
                            <p>"'Yes, monsters,' she cried, 'beasts of prey, fed with human blood!
                                If humanity, if family affections are crimes, we all merit death.'
                                Throwing herself into the arms of the elder Guadet, she burst into
                                tears, adding, as she pressed the old man to her bosom, 'we have now

                            <p>"Thus fell this admirable woman, whose magnanimity does as much

                                but Madame Paysac would admit of no denial.</p>
                            <p>"'What,' said she, 'because there is some danger to be hazarded in

                                merit is there in benevolence that is exercised only when there is

                            <p>"The scruples of St. Etienne were silenced by the perseverance of his
                                friend; he was so received into her house, and partook of every
                                consolation his miserable state would admit of. But the restless
                                vigilance of the government soon discovered the retreat of the
                                unfortunate St. Etienne, and the benevolent Madame Paysac speedily
                                followed him to the guillotine with the same intrepidity she had
                                shown in confronting danger to perfect his safety.</p>

                                his misfortunes by her kindness and attentions.</p>
                            <p>"At the expiration of two days, the stranger came to take leave of
                                her. Madame Ruvilly, whose pity and delicacy had forbade her to
                                question him, could not forbear expressing her astonishment at his
                                abrupt departure. 'I am, Madam,' said he 'a priest; if I remain

                                no one but a sister of Madame Ruvilly witnessed the scene, the
                                traces of such generous hospitality were too soon detected. When
                                summoned before the Revolutionary Tribunal, Madame Ruvilly avowed
                                the only service she had rendered to the old priest; her only regret

                                death, for not having denounced her to the Tribunal.</p>

                            they might be released upon bail, assuring the chapter while she urged
                            her request, that she herself would investigate the affair, and do them
                            all manner of justice. The priests, incensed at an interference from the
                            civil power, alleged, in reply, that the prisoners, whose lives they
                            held at their disposal, were their subjects, over whom no other person
                            had any authority. In defiance of Blanche, and in proof of the power
                            which they thus asserted and abused, they seized also on the women and
                            children whom they had before spared. The sufferings of the prisoners
                            being thus aggravated, many of them perished with famine and
                            pestilential disorders.</p>

                            determined to use with these merciless oppreisors the last argument of
                            force. Proceeding with her guards to the prison gates, she commanded
                            them to be opened. The soldiers hesitating to by her, she struck, with a
                            stick site held in her hand, the first blow: the stroke being instantly
                            seconded, the gates were quickly destroyed, when a crowd of miserable
                            wretches, their faces squalid and disfigured, and their garments
                            tattered, came forth. Casting themselves at the feet of the Queen, they
                            implored her protection, without which the grace she had conferred upon
                            them could serve but to aggravate their distress. Blanche, having
                            promised to grant their request, took effectual measures for the
                            fulfilment of her engagement.</p>

                            privilege of a British subject, and suppressed his resentment. “

                            reinforcement of gallant troops from England. Sir Walter de Manny flew
                            to her Majesty and briefly informed her of the particulars respecting
                            the six victims. As soon as Philippa had been welcomed by Edward and his
                            court, her majesty desired a private audience. " My lord," said noble
                            lady to her royal husband, " the question I am to enter upon, is not
                            touching the lives of a few mechanics ; it respects the glory of my
                            Edward, my husband, my king. You think you have sacrificed six of your

                            would be to them a stage of honour; but to Edward, a stage of shame; a
                            reproach to his conquests, an indelible stain on his name." These words
                            flashed conviction on the soul of Edward. " I have done wrong, very
                            wrong," he exclaimed, " let the execution be instantly staid, and the
                            captives brought before us." St. Pierre and his friends soon made their
                            appearance ; when the queen thus addressed them : " Natives of France
                            inhabitants of Calais! you have put us to a expense of blood and
                            treasure in the recovery of our just and natural inheritance : but you
                            have acted up to the best of an erroneous judgment, and we admire and
                            honour in you that valour and virtue by which we are so long kept out of
                            our rightful possessions. Noble burghers ! excellent citizens ! though
                            you were tenfold the enemies of our person and our throne, we can feel
                            nothing on our part as respect and affection for you. You have been
                            sufficiently tried. We loose your chains : we snatch you from the
                            scaffold ; and we thank you for that lesson of humiliation which you
                            teach us, when you show us that excellence is not of blood, of title, or
                            station ; that virtue gives a dignity superior to that of kings; that
                            those whom the Almighty informs with sentiments like yours, are justly
                            and universally raised above all human distinctions.” “Ah, my country !"
                            exclaimed St. Pierre, is now that I tremble for you ; Edward only arms
                            our cities, but Philippa conquers hearts.”</p></div4>

                            who says, “She had in some sort the government of all his (Peter's)
                            passions, and even saved the lives of a great many persons; she inspired
                            with that humanity, which, in the opinion his subjects, nature seemed to
                            have denied him. A word from her mouth in favour of a wretch just going
                            to be sacrificed to his anger, would disarm him ; but if he was fully
                            resolved gratify that passion, he would give orders for the execution
                            when she was absent, for fear she should plead for the victim." In a
                            word, to use the expression of the celebrated Munich, " Elle était
                            proprement la mediatrice entre la monarque et ses sujets."</p>
                        <p>After Peter's death the humanity of Catherine was still more remarkable.
                            She had promised that during her reign nobody should put to death, and
                            she kept her word. The test malefactors were only condemned to labour in
                            the mines and at other public works; regulation not less prudent than

                        <p>Catherine was the first sovereign that show this regard to the human
                            species ; and the lenity which she displayed was carried to degree

                            Bohemia, and numbers of famishing people flocked to the capital,
                            (Prague,) imploring relief. The governor of the city wrote to court of
                            Vienna, that the misery of the poor people was at length driving them to
                            acts of turbulence and outrage, which he had not a sufficient force
                            either to prevent or suppress. The Empress immediately despatched

                            command at Prague, to which several regiments were ordered to repair by
                            forced marches. As soon as the Count found himself sufficiently

                            of them who were assembled together, and addressing them with his hat in
                            his hand, observed, it was not by criminal modes they should seek
                            relief, because by so doing they must necessarily draw on their heads
                            the vengeance of government ; he desired therefore, nay, he begged, that
                            he might not be reduced to the fatal necessity of ordering his troops to
                            disperse them. The people listened to the Count with great attention,
                            and replied to him with a coolness which surprised him. They said, his
                            artillery and his troops had no terrors for them; that what he
                            threatened them with as rigour, they would consider as mercy ; for a
                            speedy death with a cannon ball, was infinitely, preferable to the
                            lingering death which they were suffering by famine. The Count was
                            melted even to tears. He then addressed them again, and told them that
                            his heart bled for them but it was his duty to preserve the peace o the
                            city ; and he would be censured if, by his forbearance and compassion,
                            that peace was destroyed ; he therefore entreated them as it were for
                            his sake, to disperse, assuring them that he would immediately transmit
                            a faithful, representation of their distresses to the Empress, from
                            whose goodness they had reason to expect every kind of relief.</p>

                        <p> The representation which the Count sent to Vienna, drew tears from the
                            Empress. " Good God!” exclaimed she, " what have my poor people been
                            suffering, without my knowledge! To what cruel miseries have they been
                            exposed, through the ignorance I was in of their dwplorable situation!
                            How greatly am I indebted to the moderation and humanity of Count
                            Dalton, who has saved me from the guilt of being the butcher of my poor
                            starving subjects, and who has painted in such moving colours those
                            distresses, which others, whose duty it was to make them known to me,

                            corn, to Prague ; and sent a letter of thanks to General Dalton, in her

                                could exist so long without sustenance. His suspicions immediately
                                rested on the daughter, whom he now determined to watch still more
                                closely: to his utmost astonishment he found that she nourished her
                                mother with her own milk. His amazement at this pious and ingenious
                                invention caused him to inform the triumvir of the circumstance, who
                                immediately acquainted the praetor with it. The latter, <pb

                                attention, related it in an assembly of the people. The result was
                                the pardon of the criminal; and, at the same time, a decree was
                                passed, that for the future both mother and daughter should be
                                supported at the public expense. The Romans also raised a Temple
                                upon the spot, and dedicated it to Filial Piety.</p>

                                permitted to visit him. Admitted at length to his prison, she
                                endeavoured, by every argument, expostulation, and entreaty, to
                                induce him to relent from his purpose. But her eloquence, her
                                tenderness, and her tears, were alike ineffectual: constant to the

                                be shaken. Margaret corresponded with her father during the whole of

                                closely to him in the stupor of despair. Even the guards melted into
                                compassion at this affecting scene. The fortitude of the noble
                                prisoner seemed for a moment to be shaken with the sight of his
                                daughter's sorrow. Tenderly embracing her, he withdrew himself from
                                her arms. Scarcely however had he proceeded a few paces further,
                                when she again rushed towards him, and, in a paroxysm of sorrow more
                                eloquent than words, threw herself on his bosom. Tears flowed while

                                with tender earnestness: having entreated her prayers for him, he
                                bade her affectionately farewell.</p>

                                narrative of that event.</p>
                            <q>"On Sunday, the 6th instant, N.S. in the evening, we reached
                                    <settlement type="village">Blagnac</settlement>, a village not
                                above half a league by land from <settlement type="city"
                                    >Toulouse</settlement>; but by water (by reason of a very strong
                                current, and the windings of the river,) it takes three hours to get
                                up to the town. So it was resolved, rather than expose Mrs. Morice
                                too much to the fatigue, (of which she had undergone an infinite
                                deal, and bore it with incredible patience,) or keep her late on the
                                water, to rest at <settlement type="village">Blagnac</settlement>
                                that night, where she was put to bed in the same weak condition she
                                usually had been, but not seemingly worse. About midnight, the women
                                came to Mr. Morice and me, and told us, they thought they saw her
                                changed. We rose and came to her chamber, when we found her so very
                                ill, that we thought fit to call up the boatmen, and order them to
                                prepare the boat to depart immediately, fearing <pb

                                near she was to it, she would scarcely live to reach <settlement

                                desired to do, since no physician, or other help, could be had in
                                the poor place where we then were. She herself pressed this matter;
                                and we well knew that all her desires and wishes were constantly
                                bent upon seeing her father, whom she hoped to find at <settlement
                                    type="city">Toulouse</settlement>. She was taken out of bed at
                                her own desire, and carried to the boat with great difficulty, not
                                being able to sit in the chair which Mr. Morice had brought from
                                    <settlement type="city">Bourdeaux</settlement>, with two
                                chairmen, purely for the carrying her in and out of the boat more at
                                ease; and so we parted thence about two o'clock in the morning,
                                sending two servants, by land, to procure a litter to meet her at
                                the by landing-place. About five we arrived there; and soon after
                                six the litter came, which carried Mrs. Morice to the house in
                                    <settlement type="city">Toulouse</settlement>, where her father
                                was expecting her arrival, and not knowing, till then, how near or
                                how far off she was, though he had despatched a man and horse to get
                                intelligence of us, who happened to miss us. When the servants, who
                                had been sent for the litter, returned, she was informed of the
                                Bishop's being at <settlement type="city">Toulouse</settlement>, and
                                seemed to take new spirits upon it, which, no doubt, were of great
                                use to enable her to bear going in the litter, which, otherwise, she
                                could scarce have done even for so short a way. After she had been
                                put into bed (where, as I told you, she never slept till she slept
                                her last,) and had a little recovered the fatigue she underwent in

                                particularly acknowledged the great blessing that was granted her,
                                of meeting her dear papa; and exerted all the little life that was
                                in her, in grasping his hands with her utmost force, as she often
                                did; and told him, 'that meeting was the chief thing she bad

                                and proposed to her receiving the holy sacrament the next morning,

                                it: she embraced the offer with much satisfaction. He then asked
                                her, for fear of any accident, if she was not desirous to have the
                                absolution of the church? She declared she was, and begged to have
                                it. After some little private discourse with her, he gave it to her,
                                in the form prescribed in 'The Visitation of the Sick,' and she
                                expressed great comfort of the fort upon receiving it. A physician
                                had been sent for immediately upon her arrival. When he came, he
                                gave little hopes, but said all depended upon her manner of passing
                                that night.</q>

                                the long voyage she was about to make. She said to the Bishop 'Dear

                                answered, 'Yes, my dear, I know it all; but do not let that trouble
                                you now.' She replied, 'O no, papa, I do not trouble myself about
                                that I have other things to think of at this time; but I did not
                                know whether Mr. Morice had told you.'</q>
                            <q>"Hoping by this time she might incline to take a little rest, her
                                father and husband retired, it being between eleven and twelve at
                                night; but about two in the morning she sent one of her women to me,
                                (who lay on the same floor, in the next room to her,) to desire to
                                speak to me; and when I came, she said, not seemingly with much
                                pain, but with such a shortness of breath that she was forced to
                                breathe after every two or three words, 'Mr. Evans, I have been
                                waking—these three hours—and would fain—have the sacrament.' I
                                wondered at her sending for me on that account, her husband and
                                father being both near at hand; but I found afterwards it was her
                                unwillingness, by a direct message from herself, too much to alarm
                                either of them. However, being then not apprized of her reason for
                                it, I doubted a little of her being in her right senses, and said,
                                'Madam, would you <hi rend="italics">now</hi> receive the
                                sacrament?' She said, 'Yes, I would, if possible—presently.' Of <pb

                                advised, as was Mr. Morice, and every thing being prepared, he came,
                                and administered to her, and to all present, the sacrament; and
                                afterwards, at her desire, continued repeating the prayers of the
                                church, till she began to draw very near her end, and then he used
                                and continued the recommendatory prayer only; she, all the while,
                                holding her hands in a posture of prayer, and sometimes joining in a
                                low voice with him.</q>

                            <q>"After this, her father being gone from the bed-side, she called for
                                him, (as she had frequently done,) and again said to him, 'Dear
                                papa—what a blessing is it—that afer such a
                                long—troublesome—journey—we have the comfort—of this meeting!' And,
                                indeed, when I reflect upon it, and consider the weak condition she
                                was in upon the road, the many accidents that happened to retard the
                                voyage, and the last effort she made, when she was at the worst,
                                think that that meeting seemed granted by heaven to her continued
                                fervent prayers for it.</q>
                            <q>"About this time she called for her husband, (who was always in near
                                attendance upon her,) and said, 'Dear Mr. Morice—take care of the
                                children—I know you will.—Remember me—to the Duchess of

                                time her father’s life was safe. On the 2d of September, however,

                                number of voices called loudly for Cazotte. At that name, which
                                seemed to threaten instant danger, Elizabeth rushed forward to meet
                                her father's murderers. Her extreme youth, wonderful beauty, and
                                uncommon courage, seemed to shake their purpose. One more stern and
                                hardened in crime than the rest advanced to Cazotte, and demanded
                                why he had been imprisoned with his daughter. "You will find it in
                                the gaoler's book," was the old man's reply. Two of the party being
                                sent to examine the book, shortly returned with the tidings that
                                Cazotte was detained as a decided Counter-revolutionist. Scarcely
                                was the report uttered, when an axe was raised over the head of
                                Cazotte. His daughter, wildly shrieking, threw herself upon him,
                                covering him with her body, and disdaining to descend to unworthy
                                supplications, only demanded to die with him. " Strike, barbarians,"
                                she cried; "you cannot reach my father but through my heart!" At

                                applause, from that habitation of misfortunes and crimes.</p>
                            <p>The liberation of Cazotte, however, afforded temporary security: he
                                was again arrested upon the institution of the Criminal Tribunal.
                                The good old man endeavoured to dissuade his daughter from
                                accompanying him to prison, but his prayers, entreaties, and tears
                                nay even his positive commands, were here entirely fruitless. "In
                                your company, my father" said Elizabeth, "I have faced the most
                                cruel of assassins; and shall I not be the companion of your new
                                misfortune, in which there is less danger? The hope of saving you
                                will again support me; I will show to your judges your forehead
                                furrowed with age I will ask them if a man, an old man, who has but
                                a few days to linger out among his fellow-beings, may not find mercy
                                in the eyes of justice, after having escaped the extreme of danger?
                                If he, whose white hairs could plead with assassins, ought not to
                                receive indulgence from magistrates, one of whose attributes should
                                be mercy? The voice of nature will again be heard, and perhaps I may
                                again save you from the cruel fate which impends over us." Overcome
                                by her pressing entreaties Cazotte at last allowed his child to
                                attend him to the prison. When however they arrived there, the
                                unhappy girl was denied admission, and compelled to yield up her
                                father. In an agony of grief, she hastened to the Commune, and to
                                the Minister of the Interior, from whom, by her supplications and
                                tears, she wrested their permission to attend her <pb

                                he wholly to him, spending day and night in administering to his
                                comforts. The only time that she passed away from his prison, was
                                employed in securing promises of support from the same <hi
                                    rend="italics">Marseillois</hi>, who had formerly rendered her
                                father such service; and she likewise, received promises from
                                several ladies of distinction, that their interest should be exerted
                                in her behalf. These expectations were, alas! vainly excited, for
                                every human being abandoned them in the hour of trial.</p>

                            <p>When Cazotte was called before the Tribunal the old man appeared,
                                supported by his daughter. A murmur of applause ran through the
                                multitude that filled the court at this affecting sight, while
                                Elizabeth, with her eyes fixed on her father, endeavoured to
                                encourage and console him at this trying moment. The pleading was
                                soon commenced: during the reading of the written evidence, and the
                                speech of the Public Accuser, the entire feelings of Elizabeth were
                                imprinted on her beautiful countenance. Every one remarked the
                                variety of changes it underwent; fear and hope rapidly succeeding to
                                each other: several times she was on the point of raising her voice,
                                but was checked by remembering that her father had, previous to the
                                trail, imposed silence on her. At length she heard the dreadful
                                conclusion of the speech of the Public Accuser, which was but too
                                faithful an omen of his fate. Pale, trembling, and ready to sink
                                into the ground, she was only sustained by her father’s voice,</p>

                            <p>Who in a low tone, pointing towards heaven, addressed to her a few
                                words of consolation. But though calmed for the moment, when the
                                sentence was about to be pronounced they found it necessary to
                                remove her from the hall: and when so far removed that her groans
                                could no longer be heard, she abandoned herself to a despair which
                                baffles description. The unhappy girl had seen her father for the
                                last time: she had breathed a portion of her feelings into every
                                soul; and the deep sighs which arose from every corner of the court,
                                when she was carried thence, were proofs of the homage due to filial
                                virtue. Some humane persons followed her to the prison, where they
                                found her in a swoon: on recovering herself, she begged to be taken
                                to her father, that she might die with him. It was not until
                                surrounded by her father's friends, and become a witness of their
                                affliction, that her own sorrow could receive any mitigation, and
                                the favourable moment was seized to lead her back to her family.</p>

                                fell at their feet, "Barbarians, hold your hands—he is my father!"
                                In another moment she had so placed herself, that the sword could
                                not reach father but through the heart of his child. Perceiving that
                                they hesitated to accomplish their barbarous purpose, she
                                supplicated once more, with renewed earnestness, that they would
                                spare her father's life. Even while she spoke, one of the monsters,
                                whose unfeeling heart was proof against the self-devotion and
                                heroism of the lovely girl at his feet, annexed to her father's

                                shuddering, retreated several paces, but filial affection gained the
                                ascendance, and she yielded to the horrible proposal.</p>
                            <p>"Innocent or guilty then," said one of the judges who happened to be
                                present, "it is unworthy of the people to bathe their hands in the
                                blood of this old man, since they must first destroy this virtuous
                                girl." A shout of "pardon! Pardon!" was heard from those who had
                                difficulty refrained from tears. The daughter was clasped in her
                                father’s trembling arms, and they left the prison together,
                                conducted in triumph by those who had come for so very different a

                                daughter, and led to prison. The latter had lost no portion of her
                                courage, though she had been afflicted with frequent convulsions
                                since the violence she had done to her feelings in drinking a glass
                                of blood; and she displayed each moment fresh proofs of her filial
                                attachment. When the order for her father’s trial arrived, although
                                her heart was oppressed with the most afflicting presages, she
                                maintained an appearance of composure before her parent, and to the
                                last encouraged him to support himself with fortitude, whatever
                                might occur. Sombreuil finally yielded up his life on the scaffold,
                                when the existence of his daughter became a state worse than that of
                                death.</p>

                                the mournful preference filled her with anguish. "You will die

                                this affectionate daughter. She flew to embrace her parents. "See,"
                                she cried, as she displayed the act of accusation in joyful triumph,
                                as though she held in her hand the decree of their liberty and her

                                was also a remarkable instance of filial affection. When <trait
                                    type="French" subtype="male"/>her father was to be conveyed from
                                the prison at <settlement type="city">Lyons</settlement> to the
                                Conciergerie, this affectionate girl, who from the first moment of
                                his arrest never quitted him, demanded permission to travel with him
                                in the carriage prepared for his journey. This boon she could not
                                obtain; but what obstacles can subdue the strength of filial love?
                                Laying aside the timidity natural to her sex, and wholly
                                disregarding the weakness of her constitution, Mademoiselle
                                Delleglace set out on foot with the carriage, which she accompanied
                                in that manner for more than a hundred leagues. She sometimes
                                quitted the side of the carriage, but it was only when she preceded
                                her father, to procure proper nourishment for him in the towns
                                through which they passed; and in the evening of every day, when she
                                ran forward to beg of some charitable person a covering, to
                                administer to her father's wants, in the dungeon where he must pass
                                the night.</p>

                            <p>When at length they reached the gates of the Conciergerie, she was
                                denied admittance with him, and compelled to give up the expectation<pb

                                prison. But her fortitude did not yet give way: she did not cease,
                                during three months, to implore the justice and humanity of all
                                those influential persons to whom she could gain access,
                                perseverance was finally crowned with success; and exulting with
                                joy, she hastened to bear the happy tidings to her father, and
                                contemplated the delight of herself conducting him back to his home
                                and family. But it was otherwise ordained: worn out by the excess of
                                fatigue she had undergone during this unparalleled exertion, she was
                                taken ill on the road and obliged to remain at an inn, until her
                                father could be informed of the circumstance and be set at liberty.
                                She never again left her bed, but died in her beloved parent's arms;
                                still deeming herself happy in having purchased his life at the
                                expense of her own.</p>

                                again. It was afterwards known that this early victim of filial

                                    <trait type="Dominican" subtype="male"/>He was a Creole of
                                    <settlement type="city">St. Domingo</settlement>, and was guilty
                                of no other crime than that of being rich and preserving the
                                inheritance of his forefathers. At that time when the contagious
                                example of the French revolution had spread as far as the New World,
                                the horrible practice was adopted of assembling in groupes the
                                unfortunate victims who were ordered to be executed, and then firing
                                l indiscriminately upon them with cannons loaded with grape-shot.
                                The eyes of the Creole had been blindfolded, and he stood among a
                                crowd of other unfortunate beings, expecting every instant the
                                signal of death. When, however, the order to discharge artillery was
                                about to be given, a little girl rushed forward, with a loud cry of
                                "My <pb facs="filial_025.jpg" n="50"/>

                                parent’s neck, and waited for the moment of dying with him. In vain
                                were all the threats of entreaties; neither the representations of
                                her danger, nor the commands of her father could intimidate her. In
                                reply to the latter, she earnestly repeated, "Oh! My father, let me
                                die with you." What power has virtue over the most ferocious minds!
                                This unexpected accident disconcerted the commander of the
                                massacre:--doubtless he was a father too! The voice of admiration
                                and exclamations of pity, which he heard from all sides, touched his
                                heart, and under some specious pretext, the Creole was delivered
                                from the expected punishment, and, accompanied by his child,
                                reconducted to prison; whence he soon afterwards obtained his
                                release. After that happy escape, he was often accustomed to relate,
                                with feelings of tender emotion, the heroic action of his little
                                girl, then only ten years of age.</p>

                                to place him under the roof and protection of an artisan, who had
                                formerly been a domestic in the duke's service, after which she
                                procured an asylum for herself. They were thus both secure from the
                                immediate power of their persecutors; but, as the duke’s property
                                was confiscated, and compassion is apt to grow weary of its good
                                offices, the means of their bare subsistence were soon exhausted.
                                While the daughter was suffering under the extreme of poverty, she
                                learnt that her father's health was rapidly declining for want of
                                due nourishment. Madame de la <settlement type="commune"

                            the certain road to success. The flattering results which have on so
                            many occasions attended the exercise of this brilliant talent by the
                            female sex, must be rather attributed to the energetic zeal with which,
                            from their goodness of heart, they have entered into the lists in

                            in a virtuous cause has often given rise to the most enthusiastic and
                            splendid eloquence on the part of women, who, weak and helpless by
                            nature, have thus become endued with strength, not only to urge, but to
                            accomplish the most arduous enterprises. There is no doubt that <q>"If
                                the mind with clear conception glow, The willing words in just

                            compensated for any inferiority, if such there were, in their talents to
                            those of the opposite sex. We ought to set much weight on these superior
                            instances of mental capacity, and endeavour not to degenerate from such
                            worthy examples: such patterns of merit should not be thrown away upon
                            us; for they teach us that, if the too free use of speech is attributed
                            as a failing to our sex, the proper use of that speech may be rendered
                            not only a private but a public benefit; for, as there is a time to be
                            silent, so it does sometimes happen that there is a time when it becomes
                            a duty to speak, and eloquence, actuated by sincere and virtuous
                            motives, must ever claim universal respect and admiration.</p></div4>

                            fall, for you came not to deliver us from violence while virgins, or to
                            avenge our cause; but now you tear the wives from their husbands, and
                            the mothers from their children; an assistance more grievous to us than
                            your neglect and disregard. Such love We experienced from them, and such
                            compassion from you. Were the war undertaken in some other cause, yet

                            desired very importunately to see her toilet. Cornelia artfully
                            prolonged the conversation till such a time as her children came home,

                            have hitherto most strictly observed, yet the loss of our fathers, our
                            children, our brothers, and our husbands is sufficient to excuse us;
                            nay, and to vindicate us too, when their unhappy deaths are made a
                            pretence for our farther misfortunes. You pretend that you have been
                            affronted, but what have the women done that they must be impoverished?
                            If they are as blameable as the men, why you not proscribe them too?
                            Certainly none of our sex have ever declared you your country's enemies;
                            we have neither plundered your goods, nor suborned your soldiers; we
                            have raised no troops against you, nor opposed those honours and offices
                            to which you pretend.—We presume not to govern the republic, nor is it
                            our ambition which has drawn the present miseries and misfortunes on our
                            heads; empire, dignities, and honours we never designed for our sex. We,
                            alas! have done nothing to affront you, nothing to offend you, nor any
                            thing to move you to this severe treatment of us. But you tell us, that
                            you have a war to support, and when have mankind been free from war? and
                            yet, have women ever been taxed on that account? The universal consent
                            of nations has confirmed an exception in their favour, which nature
                            herself has granted us. Formerly, indeed, the Roman women, in the
                            extreme exigency of the republic, when in danger of becoming a prey to
                            the Carthaginians, contributed towards the expenses of the state, but it

                            their estates, dowries, and houses, they only appropriated to it the
                            ornaments of their persons; nor were they subject to any estimation, or
                            informations of accusers. What is then the danger which you apprehend at
                            present? Do the Gauls or Parthians invade Italy? In that case you will
                            find us no less generous than our mothers; but think not that we will
                            contribute our estates to maintain civil wars, and enable you to destroy
                            one another. Such a demand was never made either by <persName

                            they immediately sent their lictors to cause the ladies to retire, but
                            perceiving that the multitude began to cry out against such violence,
                            they promised to reconsider the affair, and afterwards drew up another

                            disembarked at Brundusiem where all the friends of her family, and the
                            officers who had served under Germanicus, with many others, had
                            assembled to receive her. "As soon as the fleet was in sight, not only
                            the port and shore, but the walls and roofs, and every place whence the
                            sea could be viewed were crowded with spectators, who were uncertain
                            whether to receive this truly noble woman with silence or
                            acclamation.</p>
                        <p>Agrippina appeared, and landed, carrying the sepulchral urn, with her
                            eyes immoveably cast down, accompanied by two of her children: One
                            general burst of sorrow from the assembled multitude, bespoke their
                            sympathy in her sufferings, and bore testimony to the many virtues of
                            their brave and beloved general. The urn, placed on a litter, was
                            carried on the shoulders of tribunes and centurions, and, in all the

                            grief. In this manner were the remains of Germanicus conveyed to the

                            more properly claims our attention in this place.</p>
                        <p><persName ref="CPulchra">Claudia Pulchra</persName>, a near relation of

                            the prosecution against her had commenced. The prospect her friend's
                            danger aroused the spirit of illustrious Agrippina. " She rushed to the

                            in the act of offering a sacrifice to the manes of <persName

                            vehemence. 'The piety,' she said, ' which thus employs itself in slaying
                            victims to the deceased Emperor, agrees but ill with the hatred that
                            persecutes his posterity. Those are senseless statues which you adore;
                            they are not animated with the spirit of Augustus. His descendants are
                            living images of him; and yet, even they, whose veins are warm with his
                            celestial blood, stand trembling on the brink of peril. Why is Claudia
                            Pulchra devoted to destruction? What has she committed? She has loved
                            Agrippina, to excess has loved her; that is her only crime. Improvident
                            woman! she might have remembered Sosia, undone and ruined for no other
                            reason.' “</p>

                            merited, for Tiberius had indeed resolved on the ruin of Agrippina and
                            her family. Pulchra was condemned, and <pb facs="eloquence_014.jpg"/>

                            on that count a place of great importance, the possession of it
                            affording an entrance into Italy, was besieged by the Venetians under
                            the command of the Archbishop of Mayence. </p>
                        <p>"After a very brave defence, the distressed inhabitants were reduced to
                            such an extremity by famine, that they sent deputies to the Archbishop,
                            offering him an immense sum of money to raise the siege; but he refused
                            them with insult, saying, " It would be folly to accept a part, when the
                            whole was in his power.” The deputies made him a spirited reply, but
                            returned disheartened to the city. In the consultations which followed,
                            some were for submitting unconditionally as was demanded and others
                            preferred dying sword in hand. An old man, who had lived more than a
                            century, reanimated their courage, by proposing the employment of their
                            treasures in procuring succours from the neighbouring Princes; and then,
                            if their applications prove fruitless, he advised them to throw their

                            of Ferrara, and the Count, of Bertinoro, who engaged in the cause with

                            they must expect no help. Some of the most enlightened of the
                            inhabitants detected the forgery, and calmed the anxious minds of the
                            affrighted populace, by solemnly assuring them they were false. In the

                            night, Adelardi ordered his men to place two or more lighted candles
                            upon the tops of their pikes and lances. Alarmed, by this means, with
                            the idea that their number was immense, the Archbishop 'drew bark a

                            the close of his speech, Aldrude also came forward, and addressed the
                            assembled soldiers in the following manner: "'Encouraged and fortified

                            something that may be useful, though unadorned with the figures of
                            eloquence, and the reasonings of philosophy. It often happens that a
                            simple discourse acts upon the mind, while one more laboured merely
                            pleases the ear. It is neither a love of power, nor worldly advantage,
                            which has led me here. Since the death of my husband, I reign, with an
                            aching heart, over all his domains, without any contest. It is enough
                            for me to keep what I possess. What animates me, is the miserable
                            situation of Ancona, the tears of its ladies, who fear to fall into the
                            power of the besiegers. Need I enter into the detail? It is to succour
                            men, worn by famine, fatigued by frequent combats, exposed constantly,
                            to new toils, to new dangers, that I come, with my only son, who, though
                            a child, inherits his father's greatness of soul, and shows the same
                            courage and the same zeal for the protection and defence of his friends.
                            And you, warriors of Lombardy and Romagna, who are no less distinguished
                            for your fidelity than your valour, the same cause brings you here. You

                            language is not equal to the expression of our thoughts and wishes! We
                            become truly virtuous only when we prize virtue more than wealth and
                            honour! This glorious enterprise has as yet succeeded, since you have
                            passed through countries occupied be your enemies. But it is now time
                            that the seed should produce fruit. It is time to make a trial of your
                            strength, since you have occasion to make a trial of your courage.
                            Hence, then, without delay, which enfeebles the minds of most men. Be
                            under arms at the first break of day, no that the rising sun ma beam
                            upon the victory, which the Most High promises to your charity. May my
                            prayers draw down a blessing upon you; and may the sight of those
                            beautiful ladies who accompany me, animate you! If knights are
                            accustomed to display their skill and strength in cruel combats, for
                            pleasure only; if they expose their lives in honour of scarce-remembered
                            beauty; how much more ought you to make efforts for the victory! You,
                            who by the motive of your enterprise alone augment the glory of your
                            name, and acquire the esteem of the world! Let not your hands spare the
                            rebels! Be your swords bathed in the blood of those who resist!
                            Indulgence is not for those who, whilst they can do evil, will not

                            done 'talking to no purpose,' charged the jury in a sense by no means

                            the excess of her feelings, and the energy with which she had expressed
                            them, paused. His stern countenance then relaxed into a smile, and
                            extended to her an immediate liberation of her husband, he said, 'I

                            Moreover, as she had an estate in the dominions of Charles XII., and had
                            lived a long time in his court, she had a plausible pretext to seek this
                            prince. She therefore went to the Swedish camp in Lithuania, and

                            Europe, had the singular talent of speaking the languages of several
                            countries which she had never seen, with as much delicacy as if she had
                            been born there; she even amused herself sometimes in writing French
                            verses which might have been mistaken for the production of a person
                            born at Versailles. Those she composed for Charles XII. history ought
                            not to omit. She introduced the heathen gods, praising the different
