                            characteristic of Woman; compassion not only graces the educated and
                            polished European lady, but is equally inherent in the bosom of the wild
                            unlettered savage, and their distressed fellow-creatures find a ready
                            home and shelter with both: thus the shipwrecked mariner and the wayworn
                            traveller surviving their perils, return to their native country to
                            unite theirs to the many testimonies already received of the charity and
                            hospitality of the female sex.</p>

                            his Life of Columbus, gives an interesting account of Anacaona, widow of
                            Caonabo, who, after the capture of her husband by the Spaniards, had
                            taken refuge with her brother, the Cacique Behechio, who governed the
                            province of <settlement type="province" subtype="chiefdom"
                                >Xaragua</settlement>.</p>
                        <p>On the death of Behechio, Anacaona succeeded to the government. Her
                            magnanimous spirit was evinced in her amicable treatment of the
                            Spaniards, towards whom, notwithstanding the ruin in which they had
                            involved her husband, who died their prisoner, she appears to have
                            entertained no vindictive feeling.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the friendly behaviour of Anacaona, Ovando, the Spanish
                            general, imagined that there was a deep-laid conspiracy, among the
                            Indians of <settlement type="province" subtype="chiefdom"
                                >Xaragua</settlement>, to rise upon the Spaniards; and he "set out
                            for that prodvince, at the head of three hundred foot soldiers, armed
                            with swords, arquebuses, and crossbows, and seventy horsemen, with
                            cuirasses, bucklers, and lances. He pretended that he was going on a
                            mere visit to Anacaona, and to make an arrangement about the payment of
                            tribute.</p>
                        <p>"When Anacaona heard of this intended visit, she sent to all her
                            tributary caciques, and to all her principal subjects, to assemble at
                            her chief town, that they might receive the commander of the Spaniards
                            with becoming ho- <pb facs="noble_008.jpg" n="41"/>
                            <fw>HOSPITALITY. 41</fw> mage and distinction. As Ovando, at the head of
                            his little army, approached, she went forth to meet him, according to
                            the custom of her nation, attended by a great train of her most
                            distinguished subjects, male and female. They received the Spaniards
                            with the popular areytos, their national songs; the young women waving
                            palm branches, and dancing before them.</p>
                        <p>"Anacaona treated the governor with that natural graciousness and dignity
                            for which she was celebrated. She gave him the largest house in the
                            place for his residence, and his people were quartered in the houses
                            adjoining. For several days the Spaniards were entertained with all the
                            natural luxuries that the province afforded. National songs and dances,
                            and games, were performed for their amusement, and there was every
                            outward demonstration of the same hospitality, the same amity, that
                            Anacaona had uniformly shown to white men.</p>
                        <p>"Notwithstanding all this kindness, Ovando being persuaded that Anacaona
                            secretly meditated a massacre of himself and his followers, resolved to
                            anticipate the supposed plot by a counter-artifice, and to overwhelm
                            this defenceless people in an indiscriminate and bloody vengeance.</p>
                        <p>"He accordingly invited the Indians, in return, to witness certain
                            national games of his country; and amongst other diversions was to be a
                            tilting match, or joust with reeds, and all the Spaniards were secretly
                            instructed to arm themselves with weapons of a more deadly <fw>VOL. II.

                            signal of their commander.</p>
                        <p>Anacaona, with her daughter, attendants, and all the caciques, were
                            assembled in a house which commanded a view of the square in which the
                            joust was to take place. "Ovando, perceiving that every thing was
                            disposed according to his orders, gave the fatal signal. The house was
                            surrounded and no one permitted to escape. The Spaniards entered, and
                            seizing upon the caciques, bound them to the posts which supported the
                            roof. Anacaona was led forth a prisoner. The unhappy caciques were then
                            put to horrible tortures, until some of them, in the extremity of
                            anguish, were made to accuse the queen and themselves of the plot with
                            which they were charged. When this cruel mockery of judicial form had
                            been executed, instead of preserving them for after-examination, fire
                            was set to the house, and all the caciques perished miserably in the
                            flames." </p>
                        <p>Mean while a most horrid massacre took place without; the armed horseman,
                            sparing neither age nor sex, put the defenceless throng to an
                            indiscriminate slaughter, and the princess Anacaona was carried in
                            chains to San Domingo. "The mockery of a trial," continues the
                            historian, "was given her, in which she was found guilty, on the
                            confessions which had been wrung by tortures, from her subjects, and on
                            the testimony of their butchers; and she was ignominiously hanged, and

                        <p>H<hi rend="smallCaps">ospitality</hi> has been too often dangerous to
                            those by whom it has been exercised: during the proscriptions of Marius
                            and Sylla, it was considered a crime against the state to afford shelter
                            to the outlawed fugitives, and punished by the extreme penalty of the
                            law. Yet, in those as well as later times, women have been found who,
                            with a courage superior to all hazard, have dared to acquit themselves
                            of this first duty to society, and who have chosen to peril their lives
                            and fortunes, rather than violate its sacred ties. It is a painful
                            reflection that such self-devoted and heroic beings should have
                            sometimes experienced the basest ingratitude from the objects of their
                            bounty; yet it was by no means an infrequent occurrence for those, whose

                            shelter and support to the houseless wanderer, to be, in return for such

                        <p>An example of this occurred in the reign of James the Second. "During

                            promised an indemnity and reward to those who discovered such as
                            harboured the rebels, he betrayed his benefactress; and such was the
                            spirit of justice and equity which prevailed among the ministers, that
                            the ungrateful wretch was pardoned, and recompensed for his treachery,

                            distress: though she did not understand one word of English, she
                            followed Mr. Hamilton to the spot where he had left Colonel Stuart, who
                            addressed her in her native tongue, and as his case was desperate,
                            confided to her their names and their peril. She told him the cattle
                            were pasturing near her cottage; but if he would wait a little, she
                            would send the herds out of view, and get him removed without exciting
                            suspicion. Having succeeded in this, she kept them concealed for several
                            days; and when they at length quitted their humane preserver, she loaded
                            them with provisions, accompanied them for several miles, pointing out
                            the unfrequented paths, or where they might venture to ask for a
                            lodging, refusing at the same time the slightest remuneration. What adds
                            to the merit of the action, is that the poor widow had lost two sons in

                        <p>"After the battle of <settlement type="village">Culloden</settlement>,
                            immense numbers of officers and men received refreshments from Mrs.
                            Gordon, and every part of the manse, except one room, was filled with
                            the wounded. To guard against treachery, Mrs. Gordon lodged the
                            fugitives in separate apartments. So cautiously did she conceal from
                            each, the condition of the others, that the first request was, that they
                            would not intrust her with their real names: she could serve them under
                            a fictitious appellation. In this manner a father and son were five
                            months under her roof, without knowing their proximity. Colonel Stuart,
                            being a native of the neighbouring country, was personally known, and,
                            with his usual impetuosity, had introduced his friend Mr. Hamilton,
                            before Mrs. Gordon could ask him to give only a borrowed name. However,
                            she said, the gentleman must in future assume the designation of Mr.
                            Milton, and the colonel himself must be Mr. Grey. She gave separate
                            chambers to each, and as Colonel Stuart was the most obnoxious to
                            government, the window of his room allowed a speedy retreat to the lake,
                            where a boat was constantly in waiting, to facilitate his escape to the
                            upper district of <settlement type="district">Badenoch</settlement>, in

                            himself to his friends in the mountains; but the inquest in that quarter

                            hearing music and dancing, he got in at the window of his own room and
                            went to bed. He had been two days and three nights without rest,
                            sometimes hidden in caverns, sometimes even obliged to strip and plunge
                            into a bog, covering his head with branches of birch, which he carried
                            for the express purpose; and sometimes, like Charles the Second, he
                            eluded his pursuers by ascending a tree. He was now disposed to sleep
                            soundly, little suspecting that several officers were in the house. Mrs.
                            Gordon had heard they were in search of Colonel Stuart. She hoped he was
                            far off, but trembled for other guests; and the ready expedient of
                            collecting some young people, and appearing heedlessly merry, she knew
                            would divert suspicion. The officers, in place of ransacking the manse,
                            joined the merry dancers, and went away after supper, convinced that a
                            family so jovial could have no concealments. Some of the company were to
                            sleep at the manse. Mrs. Gordon had then no spare room, except that
                            occupied by her daughter; but she made as many beds as the floor could
                            contain, and the young lady with her cousin were removed to Mr. Grey’s
                            room. They undressed. One of them attempted to raise the bedclothes,
                            when Colonel Stuart awoke. He had loaded pistols, and his sword
                            unsheathed always beside him when he lay down to rest. Providentially
                            the sword came first to hand. The candle had been extinguished, but a
                            gleam of the moon showed a <pb facs="noble_016.jpg" n="49"/>
                            <fw>HOSPITALITY. 49</fw> female figure, in time to advert the fatal
                            thrust. Had Colonel Stuart seized the pistol, it must have been too late
                            to recognize the daughter of his benefactress. The shock of a bare
                            possibility of taking her life, he said, was more overwhelming than all
                            his past misfortunes. She was Mrs. Gordon’s only child."</p>
                        <p>Colonel Stuart pays the following tribute to the female sex: "In all our
                            wanderings," says he, "we have preferred applying to the gentler sex.
                            They never rejected us; and, if they could contribute to providing for
                            our safety, after separating from them, we found they had a quick and
                            clear perception of the means, and sympathy to stimulate their
                            exertions, and to render them effectual. Even ladies, who were keen
                            partisans of the House of Hanover, spared neither trouble nor expense in
                            our behalf."</p>

                            hours; during which time his majesty was apprized that a white man,
                            poorly equipped was about to pass the river, to seek an audience. A
                            chief was immediately sent, with an express order that the traveler
                            should not cross without his majesty’s permission, and pointed to a
                            village at some distance, where it was recommended that the stranger
                            should pass the night. Park, not a little disconcerted, repaired to the
                            village; but as the order had not been accompanied with any provision
                            for his reception, he found every door shut. Turning his horse loose to
                            graze, he was preparing, as a security from wild beasts, to climb a tree
                            and sleep among the branches, when a beautiful and affecting incident
                            occurred, which gives a most pleasing view of the negro character. An
                            old woman returning from the labours of the field, cast on him a look of
                            compassion, and desired him to follow her. She led him to an apartment
                            in her hut, procured a fine fish, which she broiled for his supper, and
                            spread a mat for him to sleep upon. She then desired her maidens, who
                            had been gazing in fixed astonishment at the white man, to resume their
                            tasks, which they continued to ply through a great part of the night.
                            They cheered their labours with a song, which must have been composed

                            for his friend Salles. The news of this unexpected relief being carried
                            to three companies of the proscribed Deputies, they determined to beg
                            this courageous woman to permit them to share in the retreat of their
                            friends. A <pb facs="noble_019.jpg" n="52"/>

                            the same time, recommended them not to approach her house till midnight,
                            and to take every possible precaution not to be perceived by anyone;
                            their safety in her house, which was what occupied her thoughts,
                            depended greatly on these preliminary conditions.</p>
                        <p>"They arrived at midnight. They found their friends lodged thirty feet
                            under ground, in a large vault, the entrance to which was so concealed
                            that it was impossible for a person ignorant of the circumstance to
                            perceive it.</p>
                        <p>"The continual residence of five men in this cellar, although it was very
                            spacious, rendered the air so corrupt that, as it could not be renewed
                            but with great difficulty, Madame Bouquet contrived, in another part of
                            the house, a second asylum, more healthy, and almost as secure. A few
                            days afterwards, Buzot and Petion informed them by letter, that having
                            within fifteen days changed their place of retreat seven times, they
                            were now reduced to the greatest distress. 'Let them both come,'
                            exclaimed this generous woman.</p>
                        <p>"All this time not a day passed without Madame Bouquet being menaced with
                            a domiciliary visit, not a day in which the guillotine did not lay some
                            heads in the dust. Too generous not to be liable to suspicion, this
                            heroic woman each day heard the satellites of tyrrany swear, as they
                            passed her habitation, that they would burn alive in their houses all

                        <p>"'Well,' said she, 'let these inquisitors come. I am contented, provided
                            you do not take upon yourselves to receive them; all that fear is, that
                            they will arrest me, and then&#8212;what will become of you?'</p>
                        <p>"Petion and Buzot arrived, and then there were seven of them. The
                            difficulty to provide for them was great, provisions being extremely
                            scarce in the department. Madame Bouquet’s house was allowed by the
                            municipality only one pound of bread per day; but, fortunately, she had
                            a stock of potatoes and dried kidney-beans. To save breakfast, it was
                            agreed that her guests should not rise till noon. Vegetable soup was
                            their whole dinner. After the day had closed, the Deputies silently and
                            cautiously left their retreat, and assembled round their benefactress.
                            She was in the midst of them as a mother among her children, for whom
                            she devotes her life. Sometimes a morsel of beef, procured with great
                            difficulty, an egg or two, some vegetables, and a little milk, formed
                            the supper, of which the hostess ate but little, however entreated, the
                            better to support her guests.</p>
                        <p>"A month stole away in this peaceful security, with which was mingled the
                            sweet enjoyment of generous affection and grateful friendship; when the

                            replied this admirable woman, ‘having given you shelter? And is not

                            possible?'</p>
                        <p>"A circumstance which adds infinite value to this generosity was, that
                            Madame Bouquet carefully concealed from her guests the uneasiness which
                            secretly consumed her, occasioned by one of her relations, who had
                            formerly been the intimate friend of Guadet. This man having learned
                            what passed in Madame Bouquet’s house, set in action every means his
                            mind could suggest, composed of falsehoods and artifices, the fruits of
                            a pusillanimous temper and a miserable self-love, to induce her to
                            banish the fugitives from her house. Every day he came to her with
                            stories more terrible one than another. Sometimes he declared that he
                            felt himself bound to denounce traitors put out of the sanction of the
                            law; and then he would affect strong remonstrances in behalf of a family
                            endangered by her imprudent conduct. He sometimes acted as if his mind
                            was disordered by the terrors that, on her account, he indulged in; and,
                            at length, fearing that he would take some sudden and desperate measure,
                            endangering the lives of the Deputies, she felt it justice to them, to
                            lay her situation before them. Her voice was almost stifled with grief
                            as she spoke to them.</p>
                        <p>"There was but one course for the Deputies to take; they resolved to quit
                            their happy and peaceful asylum, and the moment of their separation, so
                            mournful to all, and so fatal and <pb facs="noble_022.jpg" n="55"/>
                            <fw>HOSPITALITY. 55</fw> eternal to most of them, was fixed for the

                            not long before Madame Bouquet was arrested, together with the whole
                            family of Guadet. It was well known with what tenderness and ingenuity
                            the father of that Deputy sought to save his son, who, with his friend
                            Salles, had taken refuge under his roof. Carried before the
                            Revolutionary Tribunal of <settlement type="city"
                            >Bourdeaux</settlement>, his judges were too prudent to question this
                            venerable man concerning the concealment of his son; even they dreaded
                            the touching voice of nature, and the indignation of virtue. He was
                            simply asked why he had given asylum to Salles; to which the old man
                            answered by clasping his hands, and raising them to Heaven. Witness of
                            this afflicting scene, Madame Bouquet, as vehement in her indignation as
                            she had been impassioned in her protection of the Deputies, had not
                            power to listen in silence to such an interrogatory.</p>

                            herself into the arms of the elder Guadet, she burst into tears, adding,

                            himself, and prevail upon her to shun the impending danger by instantly
                            quitting the house. The declaration of his misfortunes, so far from

                            made her resolute not to abandon him in the hour of danger. 'It is

                            something in the appearance of this stranger that at once inspired
                            respect and confidence; his gray hairs, the traces that sorrow had left
                            on countenance, greatly affected Madame Ruvilly, whose compassionate
                            heart was ever alive to the claims of humanity. She did not consider her
                            own danger, she did not even inquire who the person was to whom she was
                            about to give a shelter that might involve her in utter ruin,&#8212;he
                            was unfortunate, and Madame Ruvilly could not resist such a title. She
                            concealed him, and sought to lessen the sense of his misfortunes by her
                            kindness and attentions.</p>
                        <p>"At the expiration of two days, the stranger came to take leave of her.
                            Madame Ruvilly, whose pity and delicacy had forbade her to question him,
                            could not forbear expressing her astonishment at his abrupt departure.
                            'I am, Madam,' said he 'a priest; if I remain longer here my
                            proscription will extend its fatal consequences to you. Suffer me to
                            depart instantly, while you are yet safe, that I may not have the
                            additional misery of bringing you to destruction.'</p>
                        <p>"'But where will you go?' said Madame Ruvilly. 'God will direct me,'
                            answered the stranger.&#8212;'What!' exclaimed Madame Ruvilly, 'know you
                            not where to seek a retreat, and would you have me expose you to such
                            danger? Ah no! I cannot consent to it. The more unprotected you are, the

                        <p>"The old man resisted so strongly the humane entreaties of Madame
                            Ruvilly, that he came off victor in the generous contest; but though no
                            one but a sister of Madame Ruvilly witnessed the scene, the traces of
                            such generous hospitality were too soon detected. When summoned before
                            the Revolutionary Tribunal, Madame Ruvilly avowed the only service she
                            had rendered to the old priest; her only regret was the afflicting
                            spectacle of her sister who was condemned to death, for not having
                            denounced her to the Tribunal.</p>

                        <p>DURING the second regency of Queen Blanche, wife of Louis VIII. of
                            France, which commenced in 1248, the inhabitants of Chatenai and various
                            towns, had, on arbitrary pretences, been imprisoned by the chapter of
                            Paris. The deplorable condition of the French nation at this period was
                            such, that the people were sold dependances with their lands.</p>
                        <p>A crowd of victims, wanting even the necessaries of life, languished in

                        <p>chapter. Blanche, touched with their situation, signified her desire that
                            they might be released upon bail, assuring the chapter while she urged
                            her request, that she herself would investigate the affair, and do them
                            all manner of justice. The priests, incensed at an interference from the
                            civil power, alleged, in reply, that the prisoners, whose lives they
                            held at their disposal, were their subjects, over whom no other person
                            had any authority. In defiance of Blanche, and in proof of the power
                            which they thus asserted and abused, they seized also on the women and
                            children whom they had before spared. The sufferings of the prisoners
                            being thus aggravated, many of them perished with famine and
                            pestilential disorders.</p>
                        <p> The Regent, indignant at the despotism thus insolent and inhuman,
                            determined to use with these merciless oppreisors the last argument of
                            force. Proceeding with her guards to the prison gates, she commanded
                            them to be opened. The soldiers hesitating to by her, she struck, with a
                            stick site held in her hand, the first blow: the stroke being instantly
                            seconded, the gates were quickly destroyed, when a crowd of miserable
                            wretches, their faces squalid and disfigured, and their garments
                            tattered, came forth. Casting themselves at the feet of the Queen, they
                            implored her protection, without which the grace she had conferred upon
                            them could serve but to aggravate their distress. Blanche, having
                            promised to grant their request, took effectual measures for the
                            fulfilment of her engagement.</p>

                        <p>Seizing upon the revenues of the chapter, she compelled their submission,
                            and even obliged them to affranchise the inhabitants for a certain
                            yearly stipend.</p>

                            prisoner by the Sicilians, and carried by them into Sicily : he was,
                            however, fortunate enough to escape the general massacre of the
                            Neapolitan prisoners, which took place immediately after their arrival

                            the Prince, sent him orders to prepare within a few hours for death.
                            Fortunately for Charles, the day appointed for his death was a Friday :
                            he received Constantia's message with an unmoved countenance, calmly
                            replying, “I am well content to die that grievous death, remembering
                            that my Lord and Saviour on this day voluntarily suffered his death and

                            from the ferocity of the Sicilians ; and by the employment sometimes of
                            sometimes of conciliation, had him at last safely conducted to

                        <p>When, after the siege of Calais, Sir Walter de Manny returned to the camp
                            of the victorious Edward, bringing with him the noble patriot Eustace de
                            St. Pierre and his fellow hostages ; the monarch inquired, “ Are these
                            the principal inhabitants of Calais ?" " They are,” answered Manny, "

                        <p>Men of Calais, but the principal men in France, if virtue has any share
                            in nobility.” 'Were they delivered peaceably;" inquired Edward : " was
                            there no resistance, no commotion among the people?" "None in the least,
                            Sire. The people would all have perished rather than have delivered the
                            least of these to your Majesty : but they are self-delivered,
                            self-devoted, and come to offer their inestimable heads as an ample
                            equivalent for the ransom thousands."</p>
                        <p>Edward was secretly piqued at this answer of Manny, but he knew the
                            privilege of a British subject, and suppressed his resentment. “
                            Experience," said he, " has ever shown that lenity only serves to invite
                            people to new crimes. Severity at times is indispensably necessary to
                            compel subjects to submission.— Go," he cried to an officer, " lead
                            these men to execution." At this instant the sound of a trumpet was
                            heard throughout the damp. The queen had just arrived with a
                            reinforcement of gallant troops from England. Sir Walter de Manny flew
                            to her Majesty and briefly informed her of the particulars respecting
                            the six victims. As soon as Philippa had been welcomed by Edward and his
                            court, her majesty desired a private audience. " My lord," said noble
                            lady to her royal husband, " the question I am to enter upon, is not
                            touching the lives of a few mechanics ; it respects the glory of my
                            Edward, my husband, my king. You think you have sacrificed six of your

                            would be to them a stage of honour; but to Edward, a stage of shame; a
                            reproach to his conquests, an indelible stain on his name." These words
                            flashed conviction on the soul of Edward. " I have done wrong, very
                            wrong," he exclaimed, " let the execution be instantly staid, and the
                            captives brought before us." St. Pierre and his friends soon made their
                            appearance ; when the queen thus addressed them : " Natives of France
                            inhabitants of Calais! you have put us to a expense of blood and
                            treasure in the recovery of our just and natural inheritance : but you
                            have acted up to the best of an erroneous judgment, and we admire and
                            honour in you that valour and virtue by which we are so long kept out of
                            our rightful possessions. Noble burghers ! excellent citizens ! though
                            you were tenfold the enemies of our person and our throne, we can feel
                            nothing on our part as respect and affection for you. You have been
                            sufficiently tried. We loose your chains : we snatch you from the
                            scaffold ; and we thank you for that lesson of humiliation which you
                            teach us, when you show us that excellence is not of blood, of title, or
                            station ; that virtue gives a dignity superior to that of kings; that
                            those whom the Almighty informs with sentiments like yours, are justly
                            and universally raised above all human distinctions.” “Ah, my country !"
                            exclaimed St. Pierre, is now that I tremble for you ; Edward only arms
                            our cities, but Philippa conquers hearts.”</p>

                            celebrated for her humane and compassionate disposition. Upon many
                            occasions during the lifetime of her husband, the Czar Peter, she
                            exerted all her influence with him in behalf of the unfortunate.</p>
                        <p> This empress received the following handsome compliment from Motraye,
                            who says, “She had in some sort the government of all his (Peter's)
                            passions, and even saved the lives of a great many persons; she inspired
                            with that humanity, which, in the opinion his subjects, nature seemed to
                            have denied him. A word from her mouth in favour of a wretch just going
                            to be sacrificed to his anger, would disarm him ; but if he was fully
                            resolved gratify that passion, he would give orders for the execution
                            when she was absent, for fear she should plead for the victim." In a
                            word, to use the expression of the celebrated Munich, " Elle était
                            proprement la mediatrice entre la monarque et ses sujets."</p>
                        <p>After Peter's death the humanity of Catherine was still more remarkable.
                            She had promised that during her reign nobody should put to death, and
                            she kept her word. The test malefactors were only condemned to labour in
                            the mines and at other public works; regulation not less prudent than
                            humane, <pb facs="humanity_007.jpg"/>
                            <fw>132 HUMANITY.</fw> since it rendered their punishment of so
                            advantage to the state.</p>
                        <p>Catherine was the first sovereign that show this regard to the human
                            species ; and the lenity which she displayed was carried to degree
                            unparalleled in the history of any other nation.</p>

                        <p>"How ill does it beseem Thy tender years and gentle womanhood, To steel
                            thy breast to pity’s sacred touch ! So weak, so unprotected, is our sex,
                            So constantly expos’d, so very helpless, That did not Heav’n itself
                            enjoin compassion, Yet human policy should make us kind, Lest in the
                            rapid turn of fortune’s wheel We live to need the pity we refuse.”

                        <p><persName>Queen Caroline</persName>, wife of George the Second, being
                            informed that her eldest daughter (after-wards Princess of Orange,) was
                            accustomed, at going to rest, to employ one of the ladies of the court
                            in reading aloud to her till she should drop asleep; and that on one
                            occasion the Princess suffered the lady, who was indisposed, to continue
                            the fatiguing duty until she fell down in a swoon, determined to
                            inculcate on her daughter a lesson of humanity. The next night, the
                            Queen, when in bed, sent for the Princess, and commanded her to read
                            aloud. After some time her Royal Highness began to be tired of standing,
                            and paused, in hopes of receiving an order to be seated. "Proceed,” said
                            her Majesty. In a short <pb facs="humanity_008.jpg"/>
                            <fw>HUMANITY. 133</fw> a second pause seemed to plead for the rest.
                            “Read on," said the Queen again. The Princess again stopped and again
                            received an order to proceed, till at length, faint and breathless, she
                            was forced to complain. "Then," said this excellent parent, "if you than
                            feel the pain of this exercise for one evening only, what must your
                            attendants feel who do it every night? Hence learn, my daughter, never
                            to indulge your own ease while you suffer your attendants to endure
                            unnecessary fatigue.”</p>

                        <p>DURING the reign of the <persName>Empress Maria Theresa</persName>, a
                            great scarcity of provisions prevailed in Bohemia, and numbers of
                            famishing people flocked to the capital, (Prague,) imploring relief. The
                            governor of the city wrote to court of Vienna, that the misery of the
                            poor people was at length driving them to acts of turbulence and
                            outrage, which he had not a sufficient force either to prevent or
                            suppress. The Empress immediately despatched General Count Dalton to
                            take the command at Prague, to which several regiments were ordered to
                            repair by forced marches. As soon as the Count found himself
                            sufficiently reinforced, he ordered all the cannon on the ramparts to be
                            turned against the city ; and hating so dispersed <fw> M 2</fw>

                            disaffected to escape, he walked alone into the midst of some thousands
                            of them who were assembled together, and addressing them with his hat in
                            his hand, observed, it was not by criminal modes they should seek
                            relief, because by so doing they must necessarily draw on their heads
                            the vengeance of government ; he desired therefore, nay, he begged, that
                            he might not be reduced to the fatal necessity of ordering his troops to
                            disperse them. The people listened to the Count with great attention,
                            and replied to him with a coolness which surprised him. They said, his
                            artillery and his troops had no terrors for them; that what he
                            threatened them with as rigour, they would consider as mercy ; for a
                            speedy death with a cannon ball, was infinitely, preferable to the
                            lingering death which they were suffering by famine. The Count was
                            melted even to tears. He then addressed them again, and told them that
                            his heart bled for them but it was his duty to preserve the peace o the
                            city ; and he would be censured if, by his forbearance and compassion,
                            that peace was destroyed ; he therefore entreated them as it were for
                            his sake, to disperse, assuring them that he would immediately transmit
                            a faithful, representation of their distresses to the Empress, from
                            whose goodness they had reason to expect every kind of relief.</p>
                        <p>The people whom the dread of death could not move, were filled with
                            gratitude for the, general's conduct; they instantly began to <pb

                            and exclaiming, “ Long live Dalton !"</p>
                        <p> The representation which the Count sent to Vienna, drew tears from the
                            Empress. " Good God!” exclaimed she, " what have my poor people been
                            suffering, without my knowledge! To what cruel miseries have they been
                            exposed, through the ignorance I was in of their dwplorable situation!
                            How greatly am I indebted to the moderation and humanity of Count
                            Dalton, who has saved me from the guilt of being the butcher of my poor
                            starving subjects, and who has painted in such moving colours those
                            distresses, which others, whose duty it was to make them known to me,
                            carefully concealed from my knowledge, representing the rising of the
                            people as the effect of seditious disposition!"</p>
                        <p> Her Majesty immediately despatched eight hundred wagons, loaded with
                            corn, to Prague ; and sent a letter of thanks to General Dalton, in her
                            own handwriting, for his meritorious behavior on this trying
                            occasion.</p>

                the ladies of Greece.
                "Sisters and Friends,—From the years of childhood your native clime has been theme of our admiration : together with our brothers and our husbands, we early learned to love the country of Homer, Aristides, of Solon, and of Socrates. That enthusiasm which the glory of ancient Greece enkindled in our bosoms, has preserved a fervent friendship for her descendants. We have beheld with deep sympathy the horrors of Turkish domination, and the struggle so long and nobly sustained by them for existence and for liberty.
                "The communications of Dr. Howe, since his return from your land, have made us more intimately acquainted with your personal sufferings. He has presented many of you to us in his vivid descriptions, as seeking refuge in caves, and, under the branches of olive trees, listening for the footsteps of the destroyer, and mourning over your dearest ones slain in battle.
                "Sisters and friends, our hearts bleed for you! Deprived of your protectors by the fortune of war, and continually in fear of evils worse than death, our prayers are with you, in all your

                wanderings, your wants and your griefs. In this vessel (which may God send in safety to your shores) you will receive a portion of that bounty wherewith He hath blessed us. The poor among us have given according to their ability, and our little children have cheerfully aided, that some of you and your children might have bread to eat, and raiment to put on. Could you but behold the faces of our little ones brighten, and their eyes sparkle with joy, while they give up their holidays, that they might work with their needles for Greece ; could you see those females who earn a subsistence by labour, gladly casting their mite into our treasury, and taking hours from their repose that an additional garment might be furnished for you ; could you witness the active spirit that pervades all classes of our community, it would cheer for a moment the darkness and misery of your lot. 
                “We are inhabitants of a part of one of the smallest of the United States, and our donations
                must therefore, of necessity, be more limited than those from the larger and more wealthy cities ; yet such as we have, we give the name of our dear Saviour, with our blessings and our prayers.
                “We know the value of sympathy—how it warms the heart to endure—how it plucks the sting from sorrow—therefore we have written these few lines to assure you, that in the remoter parts of our country, as well as in her high places, you are remembered with pity and affection.

                " Sisters and friends, we extend across ocean our hands to you in the fellowship of Christ. We pray that His Cross and the banner of your land may rise together over Crescent and the Minaret—that your sons may hail the freedom of ancient Greece restored, and build again the waste places which oppressor hath trodden down ; and that admitted once more to the felicities of home may gather from past perils and adversities a brighter wreath for the kingdom of Heaven.

                                    subtype="female"/>A Roman lady, of illustrious birth, had for
                                some cause been condemned to be strangled, and was sent to prison in
                                order to be put to death. The <trait type="Roman" subtype="male"
                                />gaoler, who had received orders to strangle her, was touched with
                                compassion for her beauty and misfortunes, and not being able to
                                resolve to kill her, determined to let her die of hunger. He however
                                consented to allow her <trait type="Roman" subtype="female"
                                />daughter to visit her in the prison, taking care that she brought
                                her mother no food. Many days elapsed, during which the daughter's
                                visits were very frequent: at length the gaoler became surprised
                                that his prisoner could exist so long without sustenance. His
                                suspicions immediately rested on the daughter, whom he now
                                determined to watch still more closely: to his utmost astonishment
                                he found that she nourished her mother with her own milk. His
                                amazement at this pious and ingenious invention caused him to inform
                                the triumvir of the circumstance, who immediately acquainted the
                                praetor with it. The latter, <pb facs="noble_030.jpg" n="29"/>

                                attention, related it in an assembly of the people. The result was
                                the pardon of the criminal; and, at the same time, a decree was
                                passed, that for the future both mother and daughter should be
                                supported at the public expense. The Romans also raised a Temple
                                upon the spot, and dedicated it to Filial Piety.</p>

                                permitted to visit him. Admitted at length to his prison, she

                                induce him to relent from his purpose. But her eloquence, her

                                be shaken. Margaret corresponded with her father during the whole of

                                closely to him in the stupor of despair. Even the guards melted into

                                daughter's sorrow. Tenderly embracing her, he withdrew himself from

                                when she again rushed towards him, and, in a paroxysm of sorrow more
                                eloquent than words, threw herself on his bosom. Tears flowed while

                                fourteen days exposed upon London Bridge, would have been cast into
                                the Thames, had it not been purchased by his daughter. Inhumanly

                                at Mrs. Morice’s death, in a letter to his brother, dated
                                Montpelier, 30th November, 1729, gives the following very pathetic
                                narrative of that event.</p>
                            <q>"On Sunday, the 6th instant, N.S. in the evening, we reached
                                    <settlement type="village">Blagnac</settlement>, a village not
                                above half a league by land from <settlement type="city"
                                    >Toulouse</settlement>; but by water (by reason of a very strong
                                current, and the windings of the river,) it takes three hours to get
                                up to the town. So it was resolved, rather than expose Mrs. Morice
                                too much to the fatigue, (of which she had undergone an infinite
                                deal, and bore it with incredible patience,) or keep her late on the
                                water, to rest at <settlement type="village">Blagnac</settlement>
                                that night, where she was put to bed in the same weak condition she
                                usually had been, but not seemingly worse. About midnight, the women
                                came to Mr. Morice and me, and told us, they thought they saw her
                                changed. We rose and came to her chamber, when we found her so very
                                ill, that we thought fit to call up the boatmen, and order them to
                                prepare the boat to depart immediately, fearing <pb

                                near she was to it, she would scarcely live to reach <settlement
                                    type="city">Toulouse</settlement>, which we all earnestly
                                desired to do, since no physician, or other help, could be had in
                                the poor place where we then were. She herself pressed this matter;
                                and we well knew that all her desires and wishes were constantly
                                bent upon seeing her father, whom she hoped to find at <settlement
                                    type="city">Toulouse</settlement>. She was taken out of bed at
                                her own desire, and carried to the boat with great difficulty, not
                                being able to sit in the chair which Mr. Morice had brought from
                                    <settlement type="city">Bourdeaux</settlement>, with two
                                chairmen, purely for the carrying her in and out of the boat more at
                                ease; and so we parted thence about two o'clock in the morning,
                                sending two servants, by land, to procure a litter to meet her at
                                the by landing-place. About five we arrived there; and soon after
                                six the litter came, which carried Mrs. Morice to the house in
                                    <settlement type="city">Toulouse</settlement>, where her father
                                was expecting her arrival, and not knowing, till then, how near or
                                how far off she was, though he had despatched a man and horse to get
                                intelligence of us, who happened to miss us. When the servants, who
                                had been sent for the litter, returned, she was informed of the
                                Bishop's being at <settlement type="city">Toulouse</settlement>, and
                                seemed to take new spirits upon it, which, no doubt, were of great
                                use to enable her to bear going in the litter, which, otherwise, she
                                could scarce have done even for so short a way. After she had been
                                put into bed (where, as I told you, she never slept till she slept
                                her last,) and had a little recovered the fatigue she underwent in

                                was about a mile, her father, whom she immediately inquired after,
                                came into her room, and was startled to see her in so very low a
                                condition. After mutual expressions of concern and tenderness, she
                                particularly acknowledged the great blessing that was granted her,
                                of meeting her dear papa; and exerted all the little life that was
                                in her, in grasping his hands with her utmost force, as she often
                                did; and told him, 'that meeting was the chief thing she bad
                                ardently desired.'</q>
                            <q>"The bishop some time after left her chamber, that she might compose
                                herself, and that he might give vent to the just grief he was filled
                                with, to see his beloved child in a manner expiring. But we found
                                she took no rest: so he soon returned, and then said prayers by her,
                                and proposed to her receiving the holy sacrament the next morning,
                                when he hoped she might have been a little refreshed, in order to
                                it: she embraced the offer with much satisfaction. He then asked
                                her, for fear of any accident, if she was not desirous to have the
                                absolution of the church? She declared she was, and begged to have
                                it. After some little private discourse with her, he gave it to her,
                                in the form prescribed in 'The Visitation of the Sick,' and she
                                expressed great comfort of the fort upon receiving it. A physician
                                had been sent for immediately upon her arrival. When he came, he
                                gave little hopes, but said all depended upon her manner of passing
                                that night.</q>
                            <q>"She once mentioned Dr. Wyntle, who you <pb facs="noble_036.jpg"
                                    n="35"/>
                                <fw>FILIAL AFFECTION. 35</fw> know had been her physician; and who
                                had so neglected her before she left <settlement type="country"
                                    >England</settlement>, as never to come near her, according to
                                his appointment, nor give the least direction for her management in
                                the long voyage she was about to make. She said to the Bishop 'Dear
                                papa, has Mr. Morice told you how Dr. Wyntle has served us?' who
                                answered, 'Yes, my dear, I know it all; but do not let that trouble
                                you now.' She replied, 'O no, papa, I do not trouble myself about
                                that I have other things to think of at this time; but I did not
                                know whether Mr. Morice had told you.'</q>
                            <q>"Hoping by this time she might incline to take a little rest, her
                                father and husband retired, it being between eleven and twelve at
                                night; but about two in the morning she sent one of her women to me,
                                (who lay on the same floor, in the next room to her,) to desire to
                                speak to me; and when I came, she said, not seemingly with much
                                pain, but with such a shortness of breath that she was forced to
                                breathe after every two or three words, 'Mr. Evans, I have been
                                waking—these three hours—and would fain—have the sacrament.' I
                                wondered at her sending for me on that account, her husband and
                                father being both near at hand; but I found afterwards it was her
                                unwillingness, by a direct message from herself, too much to alarm
                                either of them. However, being then not apprized of her reason for
                                it, I doubted a little of her being in her right senses, and said,
                                'Madam, would you <hi rend="italics">now</hi> receive the
                                sacrament?' She said, 'Yes, I would, if possible—presently.' Of <pb

                                <fw>36 FILIAL AFFECTION.</fw> which the Bishop being immediately
                                advised, as was Mr. Morice, and every thing being prepared, he came,
                                and administered to her, and to all present, the sacrament; and
                                afterwards, at her desire, continued repeating the prayers of the
                                church, till she began to draw very near her end, and then he used
                                and continued the recommendatory prayer only; she, all the while,
                                holding her hands in a posture of prayer, and sometimes joining in a
                                low voice with him.</q>

                            <q>"After this, her father being gone from the bed-side, she called for
                                him, (as she had frequently done,) and again said to him, 'Dear
                                papa—what a blessing is it—that afer such a
                                long—troublesome—journey—we have the comfort—of this meeting!' And,
                                indeed, when I reflect upon it, and consider the weak condition she
                                was in upon the road, the many accidents that happened to retard the
                                voyage, and the last effort she made, when she was at the worst,
                                think that that meeting seemed granted by heaven to her continued
                                fervent prayers for it.</q>
                            <q>"About this time she called for her husband, (who was always in near
                                attendance upon her,) and said, 'Dear Mr. Morice—take care of the
                                children—I know you will.—Remember me—to the Duchess of
                                Buckingham.'</q>
                            <q>"She also, in a proper place, recommended her servants to Mr.

                            <p>"She now found her feet cold, and ordered them to be rubbed, at the
                                same time calling for her broth; but when it came, not being able to

                                left side, and rested her head on her left hand, which she doubled,
                                extending her right hand and arm over the bed-clothes; and in this
                                posture continued drawing her breath shorter and shorter, but with
                                the least emotion that possibly could be, till she at last expired,

                                last stick of wood. They had been supported by the industry of a

                                only that he was allowed to extract it himself: the generous girl,

                                foreteeth, and went to the dentist for that purpose. On her arrival,
                                she made known the circumstances which had induced her to make so

                                her with ten guineas, with which, her heart overflowing with joy and
                                gratitude, she hastened home to relieve her parents.</p>

                                age. Closely connected with La Porte (the intendant of the civil
                                list), the fate of Cazotte was involved in his. Some of Cazotte's
                                letters being found on the person of La Porte, the old man and his
                                daughter were immediately arrested and sent to the prison of the
                                Abbey.</p>
                            <p>Shortly afterwards, Mademoiselle Cazotte having been pronounced
                                innocent, an order arrived at the prison that she might be set at
                                liberty. Elizabeth however refused to avail herself of it being
                                resolved to share her father's fate, and she succeeded in obtaining

                                had quartered themselves in the Abbey, in her behalf; thus for a
                                time her father’s life was safe. On the 2d of September, however,
                                after an uninterrupted massacre, which had lasted three, hours, a
                                number of voices called loudly for Cazotte. At that name, which
                                seemed to threaten instant danger, Elizabeth rushed forward to meet
                                her father's murderers. Her extreme youth, wonderful beauty, and
                                uncommon courage, seemed to shake their purpose. One more stern and
                                hardened in crime than the rest advanced to Cazotte, and demanded
                                why he had been imprisoned with his daughter. "You will find it in
                                the gaoler's book," was the old man's reply. Two of the party being
                                sent to examine the book, shortly returned with the tidings that
                                Cazotte was detained as a decided Counter-revolutionist. Scarcely
                                was the report uttered, when an axe was raised over the head of
                                Cazotte. His daughter, wildly shrieking, threw herself upon him,
                                covering him with her body, and disdaining to descend to unworthy
                                supplications, only demanded to die with him. " Strike, barbarians,"
                                she cried; "you cannot reach my father but through my heart!" At
                                this moving spectacle the assassins hesitated and trembled, while a
                                shout of pardon! Pardon! Was heard from one individual, and echoed
                                by a hundred voices. The Marseillois opened themselves a passage to
                                the two victims, and the father and daughter, covered with this
                                sacred shield, <pb facs="noble_042.jpg" n="41"/>
                                <fw>FILIAL AFFECTION. 41</fw> were conducted, with shouts of
                                applause, from that habitation of misfortunes and crimes.</p>
                            <p>The liberation of Cazotte, however, afforded temporary security: he
                                was again arrested upon the institution of the Criminal Tribunal.
                                The good old man endeavoured to dissuade his daughter from
                                accompanying him to prison, but his prayers, entreaties, and tears
                                nay even his positive commands, were here entirely fruitless. "In
                                your company, my father" said Elizabeth, "I have faced the most
                                cruel of assassins; and shall I not be the companion of your new
                                misfortune, in which there is less danger? The hope of saving you
                                will again support me; I will show to your judges your forehead
                                furrowed with age I will ask them if a man, an old man, who has but
                                a few days to linger out among his fellow-beings, may not find mercy
                                in the eyes of justice, after having escaped the extreme of danger?
                                If he, whose white hairs could plead with assassins, ought not to
                                receive indulgence from magistrates, one of whose attributes should
                                be mercy? The voice of nature will again be heard, and perhaps I may
                                again save you from the cruel fate which impends over us." Overcome
                                by her pressing entreaties Cazotte at last allowed his child to
                                attend him to the prison. When however they arrived there, the
                                unhappy girl was denied admission, and compelled to yield up her
                                father. In an agony of grief, she hastened to the Commune, and to
                                the Minister of the Interior, from whom, by her supplications and
                                tears, she wrested their permission to attend her <pb

                                he wholly to him, spending day and night in administering to his
                                comforts. The only time that she passed away from his prison, was
                                employed in securing promises of support from the same <hi

                                in her behalf. These expectations were, alas! vainly excited, for
                                every human being abandoned them in the hour of trial.</p>

                            <p>When Cazotte was called before the Tribunal the old man appeared,
                                supported by his daughter. A murmur of applause ran through the
                                multitude that filled the court at this affecting sight, while
                                Elizabeth, with her eyes fixed on her father, endeavoured to
                                encourage and console him at this trying moment. The pleading was
                                soon commenced: during the reading of the written evidence, and the
                                speech of the Public Accuser, the entire feelings of Elizabeth were
                                imprinted on her beautiful countenance. Every one remarked the
                                variety of changes it underwent; fear and hope rapidly succeeding to
                                each other: several times she was on the point of raising her voice,
                                but was checked by remembering that her father had, previous to the
                                trail, imposed silence on her. At length she heard the dreadful
                                conclusion of the speech of the Public Accuser, which was but too
                                faithful an omen of his fate. Pale, trembling, and ready to sink
                                into the ground, she was only sustained by her father’s voice,</p>

                            <p>Who in a low tone, pointing towards heaven, addressed to her a few
                                words of consolation. But though calmed for the moment, when the
                                sentence was about to be pronounced they found it necessary to
                                remove her from the hall: and when so far removed that her groans
                                could no longer be heard, she abandoned herself to a despair which
                                baffles description. The unhappy girl had seen her father for the
                                last time: she had breathed a portion of her feelings into every
                                soul; and the deep sighs which arose from every corner of the court,
                                when she was carried thence, were proofs of the homage due to filial
                                virtue. Some humane persons followed her to the prison, where they
                                found her in a swoon: on recovering herself, she begged to be taken
                                to her father, that she might die with him. It was not until
                                surrounded by her father's friends, and become a witness of their
                                affliction, that her own sorrow could receive any mitigation, and
                                the favourable moment was seized to lead her back to her family.</p>

                                blood,-- and save your father." Mademoiselle de Sombreuil
                                shuddering, retreated several paces, but filial affection gained the
                                ascendance, and she yielded to the horrible proposal.</p>
                            <p>"Innocent or guilty then," said one of the judges who happened to be
                                present, "it is unworthy of the people to bathe their hands in the
                                blood of this old man, since they must first destroy this virtuous
                                girl." A shout of "pardon! Pardon!" was heard from those who had
                                difficulty refrained from tears. The daughter was clasped in her
                                father’s trembling arms, and they left the prison together,
                                conducted in triumph by those who had come for so very different a

                                <fw>FILIAL AFFECTION. 45</fw> he was shortly again arrested with his
                                daughter, and led to prison. The latter had lost no portion of her
                                courage, though she had been afflicted with frequent convulsions
                                since the violence she had done to her feelings in drinking a glass
                                of blood; and she displayed each moment fresh proofs of her filial
                                attachment. When the order for her father’s trial arrived, although
                                her heart was oppressed with the most afflicting presages, she
                                maintained an appearance of composure before her parent, and to the
                                last encouraged him to support himself with fortitude, whatever
                                might occur. Sombreuil finally yielded up his life on the scaffold,
                                when the existence of his daughter became a state worse than that of
                                death.</p>

                                fortitude was re-animated by her example. When at length the act of

                            <p>In the midst of this moving scene, a second accusation arrived at the
                                prison, in which the name of the marchioness was included. From this
                                moment there were no more tears, no more exclamations of grief from
                                this affectionate daughter. She flew to embrace her parents. "See,"
                                she cried, as she displayed the act of accusation in joyful triumph,
                                as though she held in her hand the decree of their liberty and her

                                never quitted him, demanded permission to travel with him in the

                                but what obstacles can subdue the strength of filial love? Laying
                                aside the timidity natural to her sex, and wholly disregarding the
                                weakness of her constitution, Mademoiselle Delleglace set out on

                                more than a hundred leagues. She sometimes quitted the side of the
                                carriage, but it was only when she preceded her father, to procure
                                proper nourishment for him in the towns through which they passed;
                                and in the evening of every day, when she ran forward to beg of some

                                during three months, to implore the justice and humanity of all
                                those influential persons to whom she could gain access,
                                perseverance was finally crowned with success; and exulting with
                                joy, she hastened to bear the happy tidings to her father, and
                                contemplated the delight of herself conducting him back to his home

                                of no other crime than that of being rich and preserving the
                                inheritance of his forefathers. At that time when the contagious
                                example of the French revolution had spread as far as the New World,
                                the horrible practice was adopted of assembling in groupes the
                                unfortunate victims who were ordered to be executed, and then firing
                                l indiscriminately upon them with cannons loaded with grape-shot.
                                The eyes of the Creole had been blindfolded, and he stood among a
                                crowd of other unfortunate beings, expecting every instant the
                                signal of death. When, however, the order to discharge artillery was
                                about to be given, a little girl rushed forward, with a loud cry of

                                were all the threats of entreaties; neither the representations of
                                her danger, nor the commands of her father could intimidate her. In
                                reply to the latter, she earnestly repeated, "Oh! My father, let me
                                die with you." What power has virtue over the most ferocious minds!
                                This unexpected accident disconcerted the commander of the
                                massacre:--doubtless he was a father too! The voice of admiration
                                and exclamations of pity, which he heard from all sides, touched his
                                heart, and under some specious pretext, the Creole was delivered
                                from the expected punishment, and, accompanied by his child,
                                reconducted to prison; whence he soon afterwards obtained his
                                release. After that happy escape, he was often accustomed to relate,

                                to place him under the roof and protection of an artisan, who had
                                formerly been a domestic in the duke's service, after which she
                                procured an asylum for herself. They were thus both secure from the

                                was confiscated, and compassion is apt to grow weary of its good
                                offices, the means of their bare subsistence were soon exhausted.

                        <p>ELOQUENCE may sometimes effect its object by means of splendid images and
                            sublime expressions, but that alone which springs from the heart takes
                            the certain road to success. The flattering results which have on so
                            many occasions attended the exercise of this brilliant talent by the
                            female sex, must be rather attributed to the energetic zeal with which,

                            in a virtuous cause has often given rise to the most enthusiastic and
                            splendid eloquence on the part of women, who, weak and helpless by
                            nature, have thus become endued with strength, not only to urge, but to
                            accomplish the most arduous enterprises. There is no doubt that <q>"If

                            worthy examples: such patterns of merit should not be thrown away upon
                            us; for they teach us that, if the too free use of speech is attributed
                            as a failing to our sex, the proper use of that speech may be rendered
                            not only a private but a public benefit; for, as there is a time to be
                            silent, so it does sometimes happen that there is a time when it becomes
                            a duty to speak, and eloquence, actuated by sincere and virtuous
                            motives, must ever claim universal respect and admiration.</p>

                            fall, for you came not to deliver us from violence while virgins, or to
                            avenge our cause; but now you tear the wives from their husbands, and
                            the mothers from their children; an assistance more grievous to us than
                            your neglect and disregard. Such love We experienced from them, and such

                        <p>THE Celts, previous to their passing the Alps, and settling in Italy,
                            were in such a state of irreconcilable contention and disunion, that a
                            civil war was the consequence. When the opposing parties were on the
                            point engaging in battle, the women, placing themselves between the
                            armies, took up the different points of dispute in to eloquent a manner,
                            argued them so accurately, and determined so impartially, that a
                            friendly correspondence <pb facs="eloquence_007.jpg"/>
                            <fw> ELOQUENCE. 105</fw> was the result, and a civil and domestic peace
                            finally established.</p>
                        <p>From that time the Celts were accustomed, in any differences which arose
                            between themselves and their allies, to appeal to the ladies to moderate
                            between them, and always consulted their opinion respecting peace and
                            war. In a subsequent league made with Hannibal, was inserted the
                            following clause, a strong testimony of the respect which the female sex
                            had, by their conduct, deservedly acquired from their countrymen. " If
                            the Celts take occasion of quarrelling with the Carthaginians, the
                            Colonels and Captains of the Carthaginians in Spain shall decide the
                            controversies; bet if the Carthaginians accuse the Celts, the Celtic
                            women shall be the judges."</p>

                            indebted for much of their eloquence to the care and institutions of
                            their mother Cornelia, daughter of the great Scipio, whose taste and
                            learning were fully displayed in her letters, which were then in the
                            hands of the public: and Cicero, the greatest orator Rome ever produced,
                            says, "We have read the letters of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchii,
                            from which it appears that the sons were educated, not so much in the
                            lap of their mother, as her conversation."</p>

                        <p>“ Cornelia's extraction was the noblest in Rome and her family was the
                            richest; yet it was not either her birth or fortune which rendered her
                            memory immortal, but the virtuous example which she gave in her own
                            conduct countrywomen and posterity. The following interesting anecdote
                            is recorded of Cornelia and although foreign to the present subject well
                            deserves our attention. A lady of Compania, coming to make her a visit,
                            and lodging in her house displayed with pomp whatever was then most
                            fashionable and valuable for the toilet, gold and silver, jewels,
                            diamonds, bracelets and pendants, and all the apparatus which the
                            ancients called mundum muliebrem, (woman’s world.) She expected to find
                            somewhat still finer in the house of a person of her quality, and
                            desired very importunately to see her toilet. Cornelia artfully
                            prolonged the conversation till such a time as her children came home,
                            who were then gone to the public schools, and pointing to them as they
                            entered, ‘See here,’ says she, ‘are my jewels.’ Et heac, inquit,
                            ornamenta mea sunt.’ “</p>
                        <p>“We need only," observes M. de Rollin, “examine our own thought, in
                            relation to those two ladies, to find out how far superior the noble
                            simplicity of the one was to the vain magnificence of the other; and,
                            indeed, what merit or ability is there in buying up a large collection
                            of precious stones and jewels, in being vain of them, or in not knowing
                            how to talk of any thing else. And on the other, how truly worthy is it,

                        <p>" HORTENSIA, a celebrated Roman lady, exemplified the power of eloquence
                            over the human mind. Her father Hortensius was the most celebrated
                            orator of his time, and his talents were inherited by his daughter. The
                            triumvirs had obliged 4,000 women to give upon oath, an account of their
                            possessions, to defray the expenses of the state; and the Roman ladies
                            in this emergency had recourse to Hortensia, who undertook to plead
                            their cause, and accompanied them to the tribunal of the triumvirs,
                            where she made a speech in their name to the following effect:— " ‘ My
                            lords, these unhappy ladies whom you see here, imploring your justice
                            and bounty, would never have presumed to appear in this place, had they
                            not first made use of all possible means, which either their native
                            modesty, might allow, or their best understanding could inform them of.
                            Though our appearing here may seem contrary to the <pb

                            have hitherto most strictly observed, yet the loss of our fathers, our
                            children, our brothers, and our husbands is sufficient to excuse us;
                            nay, and to vindicate us too, when their unhappy deaths are made a
                            pretence for our farther misfortunes. You pretend that you have been
                            affronted, but what have the women done that they must be impoverished?
                            If they are as blameable as the men, why you not proscribe them too?
                            Certainly none of our sex have ever declared you your country's enemies;
                            we have neither plundered your goods, nor suborned your soldiers; we
                            have raised no troops against you, nor opposed those honours and offices
                            to which you pretend.—We presume not to govern the republic, nor is it
                            our ambition which has drawn the present miseries and misfortunes on our
                            heads; empire, dignities, and honours we never designed for our sex. We,
                            alas! have done nothing to affront you, nothing to offend you, nor any
                            thing to move you to this severe treatment of us. But you tell us, that
                            you have a war to support, and when have mankind been free from war? and
                            yet, have women ever been taxed on that account? The universal consent
                            of nations has confirmed an exception in their favour, which nature
                            herself has granted us. Formerly, indeed, the Roman women, in the
                            extreme exigency of the republic, when in danger of becoming a prey to
                            the Carthaginians, contributed towards the expenses of the state, but it

                            their estates, dowries, and houses, they only appropriated to it the
                            ornaments of their persons; nor were they subject to any estimation, or
                            informations of accusers. What is then the danger which you apprehend at
                            present? Do the Gauls or Parthians invade Italy? In that case you will
                            find us no less generous than our mothers; but think not that we will
                            contribute our estates to maintain civil wars, and enable you to destroy
                            one another. Such a demand was never made either by Caesar or Pompey in
                            their wars; nor by Marius and Cinna during their cruelties; no, not by
                            Sylla himself who first set up tyranny in Rome: yet after all you adorn
                            yourselves with the glorious title of reformers of the state.' </p>
                        <p>"This discourse appeared so bold and dangerous, to the triumvirs, that
                            they immediately sent their lictors to cause the ladies to retire, but
                            perceiving that the multitude began to cry out against such violence,
                            they promised to reconsider the affair, and afterwards drew up another
                            list of 400 women instead of 4,000; but to make good the sum they
                            wanted, they taxed all the citizens and foreigners, without distinction,
                            who were worth one hundred thousand drachmas, or upwards of 3200 pounds

                        <p>AGRIPPINA, wife of the renowned Germanicus, deserves to he mentioned
                            among most illustrious of her sex. The princess was distinguished by her
                            conjugal as well as maternal affection. Upon the death of her husband,
                            she conveyed his ashes from Antioch to Rome. She disembarked at
                            Brundusiem where all the friends of her family, and the officers who had
                            served under Germanicus, with many others, had assembled to receive her.
                            "As soon as the fleet was in sight, not only the port and shore, but the
                            walls and roofs, and every place whence the sea could be viewed were
                            crowded with spectators, who were uncertain whether to receive this
                            truly noble woman with silence or acclamation.</p>
                        <p>Agrippina appeared, and landed, carrying the sepulchral urn, with her
                            eyes immoveably cast down, accompanied by two of her children: One
                            general burst of sorrow from the assembled multitude, bespoke their
                            sympathy in her sufferings, and bore testimony to the many virtues of
                            their brave and beloved general. The urn, placed on a litter, was
                            carried on the shoulders of tribunes and centurions, and, in all the
                            colonies through which it passed, received universal tokens of funeral
                            grief. In this manner were the remains of Germanicus conveyed to the
                            tomb of Augustus, where they were deposited by his mourning wife." But
                            great as was the conjugal virtue of Agrip- <pb facs="eloquence_013.jpg"/>

                            An instance of her eloquence and enthusiastic spirit is recorded which
                            more properly claims our attention in this place.</p>
                        <p>Claudia Pulchra, a near relation of Agrippina, had been falsely accused
                            of a design poison the Emperor, and the prosecution against her had
                            commenced. The prospect her friend's danger aroused the spirit of
                            illustrious Agrippina. " She rushed to the presence of Tiberius. Finding
                            him in the act of offering a sacrifice to the manes of Augustus, she
                            accosted him in a tone of vehemence. 'The piety,' she said, ' which thus
                            employs itself in slaying victims to the deceased Emperor, agrees but
                            ill with the hatred that persecutes his posterity. Those are senseless
                            statues which you adore; they are not animated with the spirit of
                            Augustus. His descendants are living images of him; and yet, even they,
                            whose veins are warm with his celestial blood, stand trembling on the
                            brink of peril. Why is Claudia Pulchra devoted to destruction? What has
                            she committed? She has loved Agrippina, to excess has loved her; that is
                            her only crime. Improvident woman! she might have remembered Sosia,
                            undone and ruined for no other reason.' “</p>
                        <p>This spirited appeal of the Princess did not meet with the success it
                            merited, for Tiberius had indeed resolved on the ruin of Agrippina and
                            her family. Pulchra was condemned, and <pb facs="eloquence_014.jpg"/>
                            <fw> 112 ELOQUENCE.</fw> her fate was but the forerunner of that to
                            unfortunate widow of Germanicus.</p>

                            affording an entrance into Italy1, was besieged by the Venetians under
                            the command of the Archbishop of Mayence. </p>

                            offering him an immense sum of money to raise the siege; but he refused
                            them with insult, saying, " It would be folly to accept a part, when the
                            whole was in his power.” The deputies made him a spirited reply, but
                            returned disheartened to the city. In the consultations which followed,
                            some were for submitting unconditionally as was demanded and others
                            preferred dying sword in hand. An old man, who had lived more than a

                            treasures in procuring succours from the neighbouring Princes; and then,
                            if their applications prove fruitless, he advised them to throw their

                        <p>Deputies were accordingly sent by some stratagem, through the Venetian
                            fleet, to William degli Adelardi, of Ferrara, and the Count, of
                            Bertinoro, who engaged in the cause with all that zeal and alacrity
                            which animate generous minds to aid the distressed.</p>
                        <p>“The Archbishop, alarmed at the succours he heard were preparing for the
                            besieged, caused letters as from their deputies to be thrown into the
                            city, saying, that their negotiations had been unsuccessful, and that
                            they must expect no help. Some of the most enlightened of the
                            inhabitants detected the forgery, and calmed the anxious minds of the
                            affrighted populace, by solemnly assuring them they were false. In the
                            mean time, through many difficulties and interruptions the troops of the
                            Countess Aldrude and William Adelardi, advanced, preceded by a standard
                            of cloth of gold. They were composed of twelve squadrons, each
                            consisting of two hundred choice men; and an innumerable multitude of
                            regular and light infantry. They encamped upon a hill, not far from the
                            Archbishop; and when it was night, Adelardi ordered his men to place two
                            or more lighted candles upon the tops of their pikes and lances.
                            Alarmed, by this means, with the idea that their number was immense, the
                            Archbishop 'drew bark a little from the city, to secure a height, that
                            nature had rendered very strong.</p>

                        <p>“William harangued his army, who heard him with loud applause; and, at
                            the close of his speech, Aldrude also came forward, and addressed the
                            assembled soldiers in the following manner: "'Encouraged and fortified
                            by the favour and mercy of Heaven, I have resolved, contra, to the
                            general usage of women, to speak to you here, because I hope to say,
                            something that may be useful, though unadorned with the figures of
                            eloquence, and the reasonings of philosophy. It often happens that a
                            simple discourse acts upon the mind, while one more laboured merely
                            pleases the ear. It is neither a love of power, nor worldly advantage,
                            which has led me here. Since the death of my husband, I reign, with an
                            aching heart, over all his domains, without any contest. It is enough
                            for me to keep what I possess. What animates me, is the miserable
                            situation of Ancona, the tears of its ladies, who fear to fall into the
                            power of the besiegers. Need I enter into the detail? It is to succour
                            men, worn by famine, fatigued by frequent combats, exposed constantly,
                            to new toils, to new dangers, that I come, with my only son, who, though
                            a child, inherits his father's greatness of soul, and shows the same
                            courage and the same zeal for the protection and defence of his friends.
                            And you, warriors of Lombardy and Romagna, who are no less distinguished
                            for your fidelity than your valour, the same cause brings you here. You
                            obey the orders and imitate the example of William Adelardi, who,
                            listening only to his <pb facs="eloquence_017.jpg"/>
                            <fw>ELOQUENCE. 115</fw> natural generosity and love of freedom, has
                            hazarded his own fortune, and that of his friends and vassals, for the
                            deliverance of Ancona. I know not how to praise him as I ought, because
                            language is not equal to the expression of our thoughts and wishes! We
                            become truly virtuous only when we prize virtue more than wealth and
                            honour! This glorious enterprise has as yet succeeded, since you have
                            passed through countries occupied be your enemies. But it is now time
                            that the seed should produce fruit. It is time to make a trial of your
                            strength, since you have occasion to make a trial of your courage.
                            Hence, then, without delay, which enfeebles the minds of most men. Be
                            under arms at the first break of day, no that the rising sun ma beam
                            upon the victory, which the Most High promises to your charity. May my
                            prayers draw down a blessing upon you; and may the sight of those
                            beautiful ladies who accompany me, animate you! If knights are
                            accustomed to display their skill and strength in cruel combats, for
                            pleasure only; if they expose their lives in honour of scarce-remembered
                            beauty; how much more ought you to make efforts for the victory! You,
                            who by the motive of your enterprise alone augment the glory of your
                            name, and acquire the esteem of the world! Let not your hands spare the
                            rebels! Be your swords bathed in the blood of those who resist!
                            Indulgence is not for those who, whilst they can do evil, will not

                            it as her right, boldly told him 'that he was constituted by God
                            Almighty to govern his people, but that he neither governed himself nor
                            his subjects as he ought to do;' adding, that he wronged the church and
                            oppressed the nobles.' To which the King answered, ‘ Have the peers
                            framed a charter, and appointed you their advocate to speak for them, by
                            reason of your eloquence?' ‘No,' said this spirited woman, but you have
                            violated that charter of liberties which your father did grant, and

                            of your faith and oath. What is become of these liberties of England, so
                            solemnly recorded, so often confirmed, and so dearly purchased? I,

                            breach of his promise, he beheld with admiration the undaunted conduct
                            of the Countess; and, being checked by her stately demeanour, and severe
                            reproof, said, 'Do you deserve my favour, kinswoman?' To which she
                            replied, ‘Since you have denied me that which is right, what reason have

                            conduct it? Miss Tucker (obstinate woman) was not to be turned from her
                            own way; she had nothing to gain by mere deference to the opinion of the
                            judge; all she wanted, all she hoped for, and all she was striving for,
                            was to gain her own cause. The judge (charitable in vain!) abandoned her
                            to her fate; and when she had done 'talking to no purpose,' charged the
                            jury in a sense by no means favourable to her acquittal. The jury
                            brought in a verdict of not guilty."</p>

                            resolved, in the midst and heart of die battle, to live and die among
                            you all; to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom, and from my people,
                            mine honour and my blood, even h the dust. I know I have the body but of
                            a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a King, and
                            of a King of England, too; and take soul scorn that Parma, or any Prince
                            of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm. To the which,
                            rather than any dishonour shall gross by me, I myself will be your
                            general, judge and rewarder of your virtue in the field. I know that
                            already for your forwardness you have deserved rewards and crowns ; and
                            I assure you, on the word of a Prince, you shall not fail of them. In
                            the mean time, my lieutenant-general shall be in my stead, than whom
                            never Prince commanded a more noble or worthy subject. Not doubting but
                            by your concord in the camp, and valour in the field, and your obedience
                            to myself and my general, we shall shortly have a famous victory over
                            those enemies of my God and of my kingdom. ”</p>

                        <p>"Oliver Cromwell was one day engaged in a warm argument with a lady upon
                            the subject of oratory, in which she maintained that eloquence could
                            only be acquired by those who made it their study in early life, and
                            their practice afterwards. The Lord Protector on the contrary,
                            maintained that there was no eloquence but that which sprung from the
                            heart; since, when that was deeply int in the attainment of any object,
                            it never failed to supply a fluency and richness of expression which
                            wouls1, in the comparison, render vapid the studied speeches of the most
                            celebrated orators.</p>
                        <p>"This argument ended, as most arguments do, in the lady's tenaciously
                            adhering to her side of the question, and the Protector's saying, 'he
                            had no doubt he should one day her a convert to his opinion.'</p>
                        <p>“Some days after the lady was thrown in a state bordering on distraction,
                            by the unexpected arrest and imprisonment of her husband who was
                            conducted to the Tower as traitor to the government.</p>
                        <p>“The agonized wife flew to the Lord Protector, rushed through his guards,
                            threw herself at his feet, and with the most pathetic eloquence pleaded
                            for the life and innocence of her husband.</p>

                        <p>“Cromwell maintained a severe brow, until The petitioner, overpowered by
                            the excess of her feelings, and the energy with which she had expressed
                            them, paused. His stern countenance then relaxed into a smile, and
                            extended to her an immediate liberation of her husband, he said, 'I
                            think all who have witnessed this scene will vote on my side of the
                            question, in the dispute between us the other day, that eloquence of the
                            heart alone has power to save.’ “</p>

                            secretly into a treaty of peace with Charles the Twelfth of Sweden,
                            intrusted the affair to the Countess of Konigsmark, a Swedish lady of
                            high birth, to whom he was at that time attached.</p>
                        <p> "This lady, celebrated in the world for her wit and beauty, was more
                            capable than any minister to bring a negotiation to a happy conclusion.
                            Moreover, as she had an estate in the dominions of Charles XII., and had
                            lived a long time in his court, she had a plausible pretext to seek this
                            prince. She therefore went to the Swedish camp in Lithuania, and
                            addressed <pb facs="eloquence_026.jpg"/>

                            hastily, promised her an audience with his master. The Countess, among
                            those perfections which rendered her one of the most amiable women in
                            Europe, had the singular talent of speaking the languages of several
                            countries which she had never seen, with as much delicacy as if she had
                            been born there; she even amused herself sometimes in writing French
                            verses which might have been mistaken for the production of a person
                            born at Versailles. Those she composed for Charles XII. history ought
                            not to omit. She introduced the heathen gods, praising the different
                            virtues of Charles. The piece concluded thus:— <lg>

                            descended from her carriage as soon as she perceived him: the king made
                            lice a low ban, turned his horse about, and rale back in an instant. And
